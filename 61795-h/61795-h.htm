<h2 class="nobreak">1. <em>Science and the Study of Nature</em></h2>
</div>

<p>This volume consists of brief notes in plain language
on a variety of scientific matters. I speak of new
discoveries, real or so-called by mistake; of old well-established
facts and explanations of strange occurrences
which are more familiar to men of science than to people
who have not had the time and opportunity to ascertain
what is, and what is not proved and known about Nature
and her ways. I do not address my reader from the
professor’s chair, but from an easy chair. Just as in the
club or my friend’s smoking-room, I might talk of these
things, so do I propose to talk here. My hope is that
what I have to say will interest those who are not experts
in science, and yet have a desire for trustworthy
information and opinion on the vast variety of topics
which come up day by day for consideration and discussion,
and can only be explained or rightly understood
by the aid of that systematised knowledge which
is called science.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Science and the scientific point of view have a very
wide, indeed, an unlimited range. Though the making of
discoveries of real importance and the full understanding
of the steps by which they are made involves, as a rule,<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
long study and special training, yet there is a vast deal
of healthy excitement and pleasure connected with the
progress of science, in which all can share by receiving, as
it were, messages from the front. By contributing true
records and observations of fact which serve, in however
small a way, as ammunition and material of war for the
use of the fighting line, we can all help and take part in
the advance of science.</p>

<p>A great feature of what is called science is that it is
true. The actual result achieved by science is the
record of “that which is”&mdash;it can be examined, tested,
and proved. But science does not merely collect
accurate records of fact. In order to discover new
things, new relations, and hidden causes she has to
make use of guesses and flights of imagination. The
“hypotheses” or guesses are not wild ones, but reasonable
suppositions based on careful consideration of
existing knowledge. They are never mistaken by
trained workers in science for “facts,” nor put forward
as such. On the contrary, they are tested and so confirmed
or rejected by experiment or trial. Hence the
necessity of accuracy in observation for the purposes of
science; hence the proverbial “scientific accuracy.” It
is of no use to form a guess based upon erroneous statements.
It is mere waste of time to accept and build
theories upon loose wonder-mongers’ gossip. And,
further, the evidence which you obtain in order to confirm
or dismiss your “guess” must be equally beyond
suspicion as to its accuracy. It must be an observation
of fact free from prejudice and illusion.</p>

<p>Your guess, if proved to be true, adds to the solid
record of science new facts and new proofs of relationships,
which again lead on the imagination of men of
science to new guesses, and so to new confirmation or
rejection, and to the growth of the vast record of
accurate knowledge. To seek out in the endless whirling
complexity of things which surround us in earth, sky,<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
and sea, the truth, the knowledge of “that which is,” of
the relation of these things to one another as cause and
effect and their action and influence on ourselves&mdash;this
is the aim of science. To substitute real understanding
and the power of control of the surrounding world for
the misleading and cruelly harmful conceptions existing
in the minds of simple unskilled mankind&mdash;this is the
daily achievement of science.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_2">2. <em>The Desire to Know the World of Nature</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The practical value of science in securing the
happiness of human communities is not, however, the
reason which operates most strongly in exciting men and
women to give themselves to the cultivation and
improvement of this or that branch of it. A rich
banker one day was looking round the Natural History
Museum with me. It was his first visit. After a time
he said, “It’s very fine! wonderful! But what’s it all
for? Where does the money come in? That’s what I
can’t understand. Why does the Government spend
money on this if it don’t lead to making money?” I
tried to convince him that there exists in us all a divine
“curiosity,” a desire to know regardless of profit or loss,
a thirst which we may cultivate and satisfy, in the full
assurance that whilst its satisfaction is a delight in itself,
we are all the while fulfilling the destiny of man, helping
in the conquest of Nature. My friend had apparently
lost that instinctive thirst which is the primary impulse
to the pursuit of science, that capacity for pleasure
which Robert Louis Stevenson truly notes in the words
of the child of his “Garland of Verse”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“The world is so full of a number of things,
</div><div class="indent0">I am sure we should all be as happy as kings!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The existence of that little child and of numberless<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
“grown-ups” who have become or have never ceased to
be, in this matter, even as he, is the reason why science
has its helpers and workers of all ranks, and it is of them
that I chiefly think in writing these notes.</p>

<p>At a dinner of the Savage Club a year or so ago my
friend Dr. Nansen, the Norwegian Minister, quoted some
lines from a Scandinavian poet, which he translated
somewhat as follows: “As you journey through life do
not go too fast, do not press on blindly; there are so
many beautiful things by the way. Turn your head,
stay a few minutes. Leave the dusty road. Take in
and enjoy the wonders and delights which are at your
feet.” Motorists, please take note!</p>

<p>For those who can enter more thoroughly into
the pursuit of science there are even greater joys. To
the very few there is the privilege not merely of
realising well-established truths, and of perhaps
assisting in securing their foundations or extending their
application, but of discovering vast unexplored regions,
new possibilities, new revelations of the unfathomed
depths of Nature’s workings. Though few can hope to
be leaders in these enthralling adventures, yet we can be
close to those who are, and, holding their hands,
sympathise with their soul’s vision.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Then felt I like some watcher from the skies,
</div><div class="indent0">Or the stout Cortes, when, with eagle eyes,
</div><div class="indent0">He stared at the Pacific....
</div><div class="indent0">Silent, upon a peak in Darien.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Such a one need have none of the conventional setting
of romantic enterprise. He may be standing before a
much-stained table, covered with bottles, in an
atmosphere of acrid fumes, with a test-tube in his hand,
or he may be just raising his head with a far-off gaze,
as he sits, bent o’er a microscope, in London.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_3">3. <em>Scares and Wonders</em></h2>
</div>


<p>There are certain subjects which come within my ken
upon which paragraphs are published in the papers nearly
every other day of a wildly romantic and misleading
character. These subjects may be classified as: (1)
Living and extinct monsters. (2) Cures for cancer and
tubercle. (3) Unsuspected dangers of infection by
disease-germs. It would hardly be pleasant for me to
quote these paragraphs in order to deny their statements.
They are often headed, “For the Little Ones,” or
“From a Foreign Correspondent.” The old-established
and better title for such announcements is “For the
Marines.” I shall endeavour to mention as they occur
to me, among other things, new and duly-certified facts
relating to monsters, and to the investigation of disease.
With reference to reports which have been seriously put
forward during the past year, I may say that the alleged
discovery of a mammoth in North America 71ft. long
and 40ft. tall is nonsense. In the announcement to
which I allude, the measurements have been altered from
some original and more correct statement and made to
appear astonishing by error or design.</p>

<p>No new facts of importance bearing upon the treatment
of either cancer or tubercle have been lately discovered
which can be explained to the general public.
Work is proceeding nevertheless. No new source of
danger from disease-germs has been detected since this
time last year. It is true that the dust in railway
carriages, and especially in sleeping-cars, which are not
properly cleaned every day after occupation by travellers,
is full of microbes, and, like the dust of rooms which
have been crowded by human beings, may be a source of
disease infection. The remedy for this is careful cleansing
after each journey, and a special construction of the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
cars like a tiled bath-room, so as to avoid the accumulation
of dirt. At present this is, and long has been,
neglected.</p>

<p>Another serious and more recent danger is that arising
from the crowding of passengers in underground
railway tubes. Both in Paris and London this has been
recognised as a real and pressing danger. Trouble has
been given by the dust raised in the Paris Tube, but the
danger caused by dust has been avoided in London. It
is a definitely-ascertained fact that many bacteria,
including disease-producing kinds, are rapidly killed by
exposure to strong sunlight. Hence underground tubes
and the chinks and recesses of railway carriages are
more liable to harbour disease-germs than the open-air
roadways and the carriages which ply on them. Great
cleanliness and the use of germicide washing fluids are
the obvious precautions to be taken in the absence of
sunlight.</p>

<p>As to mammoths and elephants&mdash;the former is a misspelling
of the word “mammont,” the name given by
the natives of Northern Siberia to the extinct elephant,
hairy, but otherwise closely similar to the Indian
elephant, which within the period of prehistoric man
(50,000 to 150,000 years) was abundant over the whole
of the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere.
Mammoths’ tusks (ivory) are still largely imported from
Siberia. The biggest African elephant may, perhaps,
stand 13ft. at the shoulder. No mammoth or other
extinct elephant seems to have exceeded this. The
stuffed African elephant in Cromwell road measures
11ft. 2in. at the shoulder. Mr. Carnegie’s great extinct
reptile Diplodocus is only 12ft. 9in. from the ground at
the highest part of its back. The biggest tusk of a
recent elephant ever seen was bought by me for the
Natural History Museum seven years ago. It weighs
228lb., and measures 10ft. 2in. along the curve. It was
recognised three years ago by Mr. Jephson (one of<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
Stanley’s companions) as one of a pair which he had
weighed in Central Africa. It was in the possession of
Emin Pasha when that unfortunate gentleman was
“rescued” by Stanley and Jephson. After the subsequent
assassination of Emin, his ivory treasure found its way
to Zanzibar, and this tusk being part of it, was sold and
brought to London.</p>

<p>A real new monster of great size is the carnivorous
reptile described by Professor Osborne, of New York, as
Tyrannosaurus. There is no mistake or exaggeration
about this report. The specimen is in the New York
Museum, and has been described in detail and drawn to
scale by Professor Osborne. The skeleton stands up like
that of a huge bird or a kangaroo on the two hind legs&mdash;as
does that of the vegetarian reptile Iguanodon. The
Iguanodon and the Tyrannosaurus are of about the same
height, namely 17ft. But the new monster has enormous
tiger-like teeth, twelve on each side of the jaw, above
and below, and the jaws are three feet long, whilst the
whole head is broad and short. Iguanodon, on the
other hand, has been long known from English and
Belgian rocks, and can be seen in Cromwell Road. It
has a beak like a tortoise, and the small teeth of a
vegetable-feeder. Both animals had very short front
limbs or arms, but in Tyrannosaurus these are really
ridiculously out of proportion, according to more familiar
standards, for the whole arm is not bigger than one of
the toes of the hind foot. This new giant carnivorous
reptile is found in rocks of the same age as our greensand
and chalk in Wyoming, U.S.A. It preyed upon
huge vegetable-eating reptiles, the remains of which are
found in the same strata, and have been reconstructed.</p>

<p>The mere size of these extinct reptiles is a very
natural cause of wonder and admiration. At the same
time, it is well to remember that the body of the largest
African elephant is as big, or very nearly as big, as the
body of the biggest of these extinct reptiles. Some of<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
these giant extinct reptiles had very long tails and necks,
which the elephant cannot boast. No extinct animal is
known which approaches in bulk the great whales of
various kinds at present inhabiting the sea. The striking
thing about many huge extinct animals is that they
are represented to-day by similarly constructed animals
of much smaller size. Thus we know giant extinct
sloths, which contrast strangely with the small living
sloths of to-day, giant extinct rat-like animals and giant
extinct kangaroos far exceeding the bulk of living rats
and kangaroos. But it is distinctly not true that all
recent animals are degenerate and small as compared
with extinct related kinds. The modern horse is far
larger than its extinct ancestors, which we can trace
back in a gradual diminishing series to a little beast
no bigger than a spaniel. So, too, the earliest elephants
known are quite small creatures.</p>

<p>The interesting point about extinct animals is really
not so much that they were often large of their kind,
but that they are often of kinds quite unknown at the
present day among living animals. On the other hand
sometimes (but by no means always) they can be shown
to be connected as ancestors to living animals by a
series of intermediate forms. The remains of the connecting
forms are found embedded in successive rock-strata,
intermediate in age between the present day and
the remote period when the earliest members of the
series were alive and flourishing&mdash;and we can follow
out in many instances (for example, in the pedigree of
the horse, and again of the elephant) the gradual but
very extensive changes by which the descendants of a
long extinct kind of animal have been “transformed”
into modern recent animals, familiar to us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_4">4. <em>Work at the Pasteur Institute</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Professor Elias Metschnikoff was busy, when I saw him
at the Institut Pasteur in Paris last September, with an
experimental investigation of “appendicitis.” He finds
that chimpanzees can exhibit this disease, and he is led
by experiments on those animals to believe that a gas-producing
micro-organism&mdash;the bacillus aërogenicus&mdash;already
known as occurring in the human intestine&mdash;is
especially active in exciting the disease. Parasitic
worms or other foreign bodies must first wound the
delicate lining of the appendix before the virulent gas-forming
bacillus can penetrate and start inflammation
and abscess. Metschnikoff was also investigating a
disease of tropical regions, known as “the Yaws.” Most
people would imagine that this name refers to a disease
like the gapes, but it is quite different, being an ulceration
of the skin caused by a spirillum.</p>

<p>Spirilla&mdash;corkscrew-like threads of excessive minuteness&mdash;are
parasitic organisms, like bacteria, bacilli, and
micrococci. They are of different kinds&mdash;some harmless,
some deadly. One is common in the mouth of the
healthiest of us&mdash;another causes one of our most terrible
diseases. They can be distinguished by the microscope,
though much alike. What microscopists call “dark-ground
illumination”&mdash;that is, illumination by horizontal
rays of light, obtained by a prism attached
below the glass slip on which the object is placed for
examination with the microscope, has been found at the
Institut Pasteur to be a very ready way of showing the
spirilla in fresh blood or sputum. The spirilla are alive,
and are seen when highly magnified, shooting rapidly
across the field of view with a corkscrew action, like
brilliant silver threads. The detection of the microbe
which causes an infective disease, is often the first step<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
to the control of the disease, or to knowledge which
enables man to avoid the disease altogether. Some
striking examples of this have occurred of late years.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_5">5. <em>The Sea Serpent</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The sea-serpent rarely puts in an appearance now,
though a Cornish “manifestation” was reported last
year. A recent account of a strange marine monster,
declared by some to be, of course, the sea-serpent, seen
but to disappear, was that given by Lord Crawford’s
companions two years ago. In that case, and in
others in which a huge fin-like structure, supported by
fin-rays, has been seen projecting from the mysterious
animal, it is not improbable that what was seen was a
large seal of the “eared” kind, raising one of its long,
webbed hind-feet from the water, a trick which some of
them are known to have. Other reputed sea-serpents
have been, in reality, a school of porpoises, or a line-like
flight of sea-birds, or a mass of seaweed, or a whale in
association with one or other of these&mdash;or, again, a real
marine snake 5ft. long (such are well known and very
poisonous), or a ribbon-fish 12ft. long. There is “no
reason why there should not be” a huge and seldom-seen
kind of animal living in the sea&mdash;like a serpent in
appearance. No one can say, as the result of observation,
that there is not, since no one has thoroughly explored
the dark, unfathomed depths of ocean. Yet we gain
very little when we have admitted our ignorance, and
agreed that there is no reason why something should not
be. The real question is, “Does the thing in question
exist?” not “Could it possibly exist?” Does the great
sea-serpent exist? The answer to that is, There is not
much evidence to show that it does. Most persons who
have looked into the matter would be willing to bet
100,000 to 1 against its being captured, dead or alive,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
and brought before the Royal Society within ten years’
time. Unless it be so captured and “tabled” it
matters very little whether it exists or not. It must be
“discovered” in order to become really interesting.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_6">6. <em>Giraffes and the Okapi</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The baby giraffe at the gardens in the Regent’s Park
is a most interesting and beautiful creature. In that
respect she only resembles on a small scale her grown-up
relatives. Next to elephants, giraffes take precedence
for strangeness, beauty, and imposing size. Certainly
they have done so with me ever since I turned one
Sunday afternoon long ago from the great novelty of
the day, the first hippopotamus sent from Egypt, round
whom the world of fashion was crowding, and gazed
into the beautiful eyes that hung over me, supported by
a gracefully-curving neck. My tender regard for the
beautiful creature was not shaken even when I felt a
sudden jerk to the elastic band passing under my chin
and saw my new Leghorn straw hat, with its ornamental
bunch of Egyptian wheat and broad pink ribbon, disappear
between the lips of the beauty. A slow right
and left movement of the jaw followed, accompanied by
a tranquil kindly look suggestive of a desire for more.
That was one of the old stock of Regent’s Park giraffes,
who bred freely at the gardens and made money for the
society. They died out thirty years ago or more.
From time to time since then there have been one or
two mis-shapen giraffes in London, but they did not
eat children’s hats nor produce young of their own. A
new dynasty of Kordofan giraffes has now arrived, and
a better spirit prevails.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about the giraffe is the
okapi. The remark sounds absurd, but it is true. The
okapi is the new animal from the Congo forest of<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
Central Africa, discovered in 1901 by Sir Harry
Johnston. It is as big as a very large stag, has a neck
like a deer, and is striped on the haunches and legs, not
spotted as is the giraffe. Yet its teeth and its horns
prove it to be a close ally, not of deer, but of the
giraffe. Any points of agreement between giraffes and
the okapi are, therefore, important. I have examined
the baby giraffe at the Zoo, and find that she has
stripe-like bands of hair on the face and on other parts
of the head. Both her father and mother are from
Kordofan, and have some six or seven strongly-marked
bands of dark hair over the eyes and on the muzzle. It
is important to note any colour-striping in the giraffe’s
skin, since the giraffe’s colour-markings are mostly in
the form of great spots, whilst the okapi is only marked
by stripes or bands something like those of a zebra, but
confined to the haunches and the legs, the rest of the
body being dark brown. The tendency to develop
colour stripes in the giraffe is important, since it shows
us that the stripes do not separate the okapi absolutely
from the camelopard; they are a common possession or
possibility of the two animals. It was my examination
of a half-brother of the little giraffe now alive at the
Gardens which led to the discovery of striping on the
head and face of giraffes. The mother in that case had
died before the birth of her young one, and the dead
calf was given to me by the secretary of the Zoological
Society. Sixty-eight years ago Sir Richard (then
Professor) Owen received a new-born giraffe from the
Gardens, and reported on it to the Zoological Society.
No one had examined one since that date; none were
obtainable from the Zoo, and I could get none from
African travellers and sportsmen, in spite of urgent
requests. I was accordingly greatly pleased to secure
one from the London Gardens. A great peculiarity
of the young giraffe is that it is born with a pair of
well-grown horns, nearly an inch long, and covered<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
with coarse black hair. No other horn-bearing mammal&mdash;no
antelope, buffalo, ox, sheep, goat, stag, or
other deer&mdash;is born with horns, so far as we know,
and we know a good many of these animals well.
Before birth the young giraffe’s horns are flat from
back to front, and quite soft and flexible. They
can be pressed backwards, so as to be made to lie
flat on the head. Directly after birth a hard, bony
deposit commences inside the horn, and after some
years’ growth it becomes firmly fused to the skull. But
the hard bony core never breaks through the hairy skin
which covers it. The bony core of the okapi’s pair of
horns, on the contrary, does “cut” or break through
the skin, exposing a sharp, hard point, a quarter of an
inch in length. In the deer tribe, as everyone knows,
the point of the bony horn-core spreads out as a large,
branching growth from which all covering is shed, and
forms the “antler.” The deer tribe shed the antlers
every year from the top of the horn-core, and grow
a new and larger pair to take the place of the old
ones. Moreover, in them the horn-core itself is a
stem-like upgrowth of the bone of the skull (of the
frontal bone). In the okapi and the giraffe the
horn-core is a separate bone, free at first and fusing
with the skull only when the adult condition is
reached. The little antlers or bare-points of the okapi’s
horn-cones or cores seem to be shed in segments as
growth goes on, and are only minute things compared
with the antlers of stags. The giraffe’s horns, on the
other hand, always remain covered by skin and hair
and have a broad, rounded top, not a sharp point.</p>

<p>The real clinching feature in the okapi and giraffe
which decides at once their close affinity to one another
is found in the outer tooth on each side of the group of
eight teeth placed in the front of the lower jaw. In
both this particular tooth has a broad, chisel-like crown,
divided into two portions by a deep vertical slit. None<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
of the other ungulate or hoofed animals have this
very curious shape of tooth. It is a sort of family
“mark” or “feature” in okapis and giraffes, as may be
seen in specimens shown in the gallery of the Natural
History Museum, where we have now no less than
three fine, well-stuffed okapis and several varieties of
giraffe.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_7">7. <em>The Great Geologists of Last Century</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The centenary of the foundation of the Geological
Society of London, celebrated last year, was a genuine
festival in the scientific world. Though geology had
its teachers and searchers before 1807 (Hutton and
Werner, and the Neptunian and Plutonic schools,
with their theories as to the origin of rocks on the
one hand by marine deposit, or on the other by
igneous agency, flourished before that date), yet it is
true that the adequate conception of the problems
of geology and the proper use of accurate observations
and of judicious theory based on those observations,
in relation to the problems of geology,
coincided with the foundation of the society. It
was not the first “special” scientific society founded
in London; there was already the Linnean Society
(founded in 1788) for the cultivation of zoology and
botany. Yet it incurred the displeasure of the worthy
president of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, who
at first joined it, and then withdrew from it, when,
in 1809, it ceased to be a dining-club, meeting at a
London tavern, and acquired rooms of its own at
No. 4, Garden-court, Temple. Apparently there was
a notion in those days that the “Royal Society for the
promotion of Natural Knowledge,” founded in 1662,
should exercise a sort of paternal control over any
society formed for the special promotion of one branch<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
of science. Independence has, however, been found to
be the healthiest condition, and we now have not only
the Linnean and the Geological, but the Zoological,
the Chemical, and the Physical Societies, vigorous and
important corporations, publishing their “Transactions,”
and meeting for discussion. There is, it is true, a
danger that the Royal Society may be left eventually,
owing to these independent establishments, in the sole
possession and control of the doctors and the engineers.
It is a curious fact that the word “physiology,” which
in Cicero’s time (he says “Physiologia naturæ ratio”)
and in the Middle Ages meant what we now call
“natural history,” has been abandoned by other sciences,
and appropriated by the medical men. In England,
but not abroad, the doctors have even usurped the
words “physician” and “physic.” In France, on the
contrary, and more correctly, Lord Rayleigh and Sir
William Crooks are called distinguished “physicians,”
and the theory of the luminiferous ether is “physic.”</p>

<p>The Geological Society issued its first volume of
Transactions in 1811. The origin of the society is
there stated to be due to “the desire of its founders
to communicate to each other the results of their
observations, and to examine how far the opinions
maintained by the writers on geology are in conformity
with the facts presented by nature.” A more exact and
intelligible statement of the attitude of scientific men,
then and now, could not be formulated.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, among us now who knew many
of the original members of the Geological Society, but
I remember meeting, when I was a youth, Leonard
Horner, the first secretary of the society, and father-in-law
of Sir Charles Lyell. I also knew Dr. Peter Mark
Roget, an original member, who was the oldest fellow
of the Royal Society when he died in 1869. Sir Henry
Holland, the father of the present Lord Knutsford,
became a member in 1809, and published a paper<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
on the rock-salt district in the first volume. He was
an eminent medical man, and a great traveller. He
wrote, amongst other things, upon the turquoise mines
of Persia and upon longevity. He was a friend of my
father’s, and I had the advantage of talking the latter
subject over with him before I wrote a little book on
“Comparative Longevity” in 1869.</p>

<p>It was not until 1825 that the Geological Society
obtained a charter, and was incorporated. Two great
names appear in the first council of the newly-incorporated
society&mdash;Murchison and Lyell. Murchison
became the Director of the Geological Survey, and
as “Sir Roderick” was a familiar and picturesque
figure in the scientific world of the second and third
quarters of last century. He wore an Inverness cape
and a tall hat with a large and much-curled brim,
an old-fashioned stock, and a tail-coat. In his hand
he always grasped a large, handsome cane, with which
he expressed his applause during the discussions at the
society, or emphasised his own remarks. He was fond
of alluding to himself as “an old soldier of the hammer,”
and almost always entered into a discussion with these
words, “It is now, sir, a quarter of a century since, in
company with my illustrious friend, Sir Somebody
Something, I had the privilege and pleasure of showing
that”&mdash;whatever it might be. Discussions at the
Geological in the sixties and seventies were real,
animated, almost violent discussions. I need hardly
say that they were perfectly delightful. Godwin
Austen was a fine, incisive speaker, who seemed ready
to back his statements and views with his fists, if need
be. Lyell, the greatest of all, was most modest, and
almost timid in pressing an opinion, but full of personal
experience and minute knowledge of facts. John Phillips,
the nephew of the father of English geology, William
Smith, was mellifluous and persuasive; Jukes, robust
and defiant; Huxley (secretary and then president),<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
clear, trenchant, and uncompromising. I remember
an occasion when Sir Roderick, with tears in his voice,
if not in his eyes, declared he would not stay in the
room to hear that fossil fishes were discovered in his
own special domain&mdash;the Silurian rocks, where he had
long since shown that they did not occur&mdash;and he left
the meeting. Many Silurian fishes have now been
found, but we all loved Sir Roderick for the heart
and feeling which he threw into his work and his
public utterances.</p>

<p>The aim of geology is to describe accurately the long
succession of changes in the crust of “this cooling
cinder,” the earth, and to assign them in an orderly
way to their causes. Hence, it calls upon nearly all
other branches of science for help&mdash;astronomy, physics,
chemistry, mineralogy, botany, and zoology. At the
same time, it is essentially a recreative pursuit, for,
as Mr. Horace Woodward says in his <cite>History of the
Geological Society of London</cite>&mdash;published by the society&mdash;“the
fulness of the science can never be attained
without the vivifying influence of mountain and moor,
of valley and sea coast.” It is owing to this that
the soldiers of the hammer, from Murchison, Sedgwick,
Lyell, Ramsay, Etheridge, Salter, onwards to the
present generation of “stone-crackers,” are amongst
the happiest, most genial, and mentally alert of our
men of science.</p>

<p>That word “stone-cracker” I take from a letter
addressed to me when I was a boy of twelve by the
Rev. J. S. Henslow, Professor of Mineralogy and later
of Botany at Cambridge, founder, with Adam Sedgwick,
the great Woodwardian Professor of Geology, of the
now flourishing Cambridge Philosophical Society, and
the teacher, guide, and fateful friend of Charles Darwin.
It was he who sent Darwin on the voyage of the <em>Beagle</em>.
I had met this wonderful old naturalist at Felixstowe
when exploring the marshes for rare plants and insects<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
with my father. My father was a first-rate man at
a country walk, and could tell you all the time about
the flowers, flies, stones, and bones you might encounter.
But Henslow surpassed him. I remember to this day
nearly every word Henslow said, and everything he did
on that memorable afternoon nearly fifty years ago.
Amongst other things he explained how the rough flint
implements recently discovered in river gravels&mdash;proving
man’s great antiquity&mdash;could be shown to owe their
shape to blows, each blow causing a “conchoidal”
fracture. And he struck with his hammer some very
large flints which were lying in a heap in the meadow,
and produced the most perfect dome-like broken
surface or bulb of percussion. He promised to give
me a real palæolithic flint implement and also a
geological hammer. The letter which reached me
later in London ran as follows: “Dear incipient
Stonecracker&mdash;Enclosed you will find a draft for 10<em>s.</em>
with which, at the shop in Newgate-street, you can
obtain a geological hammer identical in all respects
with my own.... In a separate parcel I send you
a flint implement which I obtained myself in the
gravel pit at St. Acheuil....” The hammer, the
flint-axe, and the letter are to this day treasured with
deep affection and reverence for the giver, by the
boy who was thus so kindly initiated in the “art
and mystery” of Stone-crackers. Henslow died in
1861 at the age of 65. His daughter was the first
wife of Sir Joseph Hooker, the great botanist and
traveller, who celebrated his ninetieth birthday in
July, 1907, and is still in full mental and bodily
health and vigour.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_8">8. <em>Experiments with Precious Stones</em></h2>
</div>


<p>A man of science cannot say a word about experiments
with precious stones nowadays, but he is liable to
be misunderstood and represented as having discovered
how to make valuable gems out of dirt, or of enormous
size, and in vast quantity. Last year the production
of a few small crystals by the electrical decomposition
of bisulphide of carbon was announced as something
to affect the stock market instead of as a matter
of interest to a few learned chemists. The crystals were
supposed&mdash;erroneously as it turned out&mdash;to be diamond.
We were also gravely told that a competent French
chemist had discovered, and that the distinguished
geologist, Professor Lapparent, had communicated the
fact to the Academy of Sciences, that the radiation of
radium acting on “corindon,” or, as we should prefer to
write it in England, “corundum”&mdash;a base, dull, colourless
crystal&mdash;converts that dull substance into sapphires,
rubies, emeralds, and topazes&mdash;and that the dealers
attest the value of the precious stones so produced.
This is really great nonsense, and arises from a little
confusion in the use of the names of precious stones,
and ignorance of what the substances indicated by those
names are&mdash;defects which we cannot attribute to the
French chemist, but must suppose to have “crept in”
to the reports which crossed the Channel. Corundum
is a colourless crystal, opaque or translucent. In
chemical composition it is the oxide of aluminium&mdash;standing
in the same relation to that light, white metal
as rust or hematite ore does to the metal iron. It
would not be at all astounding if by simple treatment
we could convert corundum into sapphire or into ruby,
since sapphire and ruby have precisely the same chemical
constitution as corundum&mdash;are, in fact, only coloured
varieties of corundum. Sapphire is blue, transparent<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
corundum; green and yellow “sapphires” are also
common. The Oriental ruby is similarly only red,
transparent corundum&mdash;like it only oxide of aluminium
or alumina.</p>

<p>Diamonds are pure crystalline transparent carbon.
Commonly they are colourless and transparent, but are
sometimes black or white and opaque. Transparent
diamonds are often found of a straw colour, rarely
of a deep blue (the Hope Diamond), more rarely
green (the Dresden Diamond), and rarest of all
red.</p>

<p>If radium were really able (as some people have
wrongly inferred from the French experiments) to
change the chemical nature of corundum and convert
it into topaz and emerald, the case would be very
different from that of merely changing the colour of
the corundum. What is to-day called “topaz” is a
sherry-yellow crystal consisting of silicate of alumina
and of fluoride of alumina. It turns pink when heated,
and is also known of a blue colour and colourless. The
topaz of the ancients from the coasts of the Red Sea
is of a different chemical nature, and is now called
peridot. Yellow corundum is sometimes wrongly called
Oriental topaz, and the yellow-brown quartz crystals
properly known as cairngorms are sometimes wrongly
called Scotch topaz. So that the word “topaz” is used
loosely as well as strictly, and confusion results. Emerald
is widely distinct from corundum, sapphire, and ruby.
It is a silicate of alumina and beryllium, and in its
coarse and pale-coloured variety is known as beryl.</p>

<p>From all this it appears that some names of precious
stones indicate substances quite distinct from one
another chemically, built of differing elements, and also
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</i> that what is actually one and the same kind
of precious stone in chemical composition and native
crystalline form may present examples possessing various
colours and degrees of transparency, each variety being<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
called by a distinct name, and regarded popularly as a
distinct kind of stone. Radium rays can convert
colourless alumina or corundum into blue alumina
(sapphire) or red alumina (ruby), but they cannot
change alumina into beryllia (that is into emerald), nor
into fluoride (that is into topaz).</p>

<p>One naturally asks, “To what is the colour of these
precious stones due?” The answer is difficult, because
very minute traces of chemical impurity, such as iron,
cobalt, manganese, or chromium may suffice to tint an
otherwise transparent, colourless crystal with the
brightest red, yellow, blue, violet, or green. Moreover,
it is certain from what we know of traces of metallic
impurity in artificial glass that it may exist in such a
state of chemical combination as to give no tint whatever
to the glass, but after prolonged exposure to light
or other agencies, the minute impurity may combine
chemically with oxygen present in the glass and develop
colour. Thus, for instance, old window-glass often
assumes a violet or amethystine tint after long exposure.
This varying colour of the combinations of metals
according to whether they are oxidised or not, and the
degree of oxidation, or the special salt which they may
form, is in itself an unexpected thing to those who are
not chemists. The metal chromium, for instance, gives
rise to colourless, to yellow, red, green, and blue combinations.
Manganese, a metal commonly associated
with iron, gives rise to brilliant green, to violet, and to
wine-red combinations, and if scattered as microscopic
particles of black oxide in glass would produce no colour
effect at all. From what we know of glass and the ease
with which it is coloured to every shade of the rainbow
by the admixture of traces of metallic impurities&mdash;so
that “paste” or glass gems of all colours can be manufactured&mdash;it
is not surprising to find that natural
crystals, transparent and often devoid of colour (such as
corundum, diamond, quartz, and topaz), are yet also<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
found more or less frequently coloured in various tints.
Nevertheless, it is the fact that in very few cases have
chemists been able to prove by analysis what precisely is
the cause of the colour in any given crystal or precious
stone, although they may strongly suspect this or that
as the colour-giving impurity. The actual quantity of
a metallic impurity sufficient to give a tint is so
excessively minute that the chemist finds it impossible
to determine what it is by examining one small precious
stone. He has not a sufficient bulk of material to
operate on.</p>

<p>Having reached this point, we can see that such
potent disturbing agents as the rays of radium&mdash;penetrating
a colourless, or faintly-coloured, crystal&mdash;may
determine oxidation or other chemical combination
within the crystal of traces of metal (iron, cobalt, manganese,
chromium) already present there, and so give
it an increased colour or an altogether new tint. In
1905 (therefore long before the recent French experiments
had shown that the radium rays will act in this
way on corundum, the “base variety” of sapphire and
ruby), Sir William Crookes published an account of his
experiments as to the action of the radium rays on the
diamond. “Some fine colourless crystals of diamond,”
writes Sir William Crookes in 1905, “were embedded
in radium bromide, and kept undisturbed for more than
twelve months. At the end of that time they were
examined. The radium had caused them to assume a
beautiful bluish-green colour, and their value as ‘fancy
stones’ had been materially increased.” On another
occasion Sir William found that a yellowish “off colour”
diamond had its tint changed to a pale blue-green when
embedded for six weeks in a tube with radium bromide.
(I have seen this stone.) He also has succeeded in
improving the clearness of diamonds by exposing them
to radium rays. Everyone who has experimented with
radium knows that it causes the glass which may be<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
used to keep it covered to develop a brown or purple
tint. This, then, is the explanation of the results
obtained by the French observer with corundum, as
reported a few months ago. There was no “transformation”
of one substance into another, nor did he
himself suggest that there was. The radium rays
merely acted chemically on minute impurities present
in colourless or pale-coloured crystals, and so produced
colour as they do in diamonds or in glass.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_9">9. <em>Diamonds</em></h2>
</div>


<p>His Majesty King Edward was presented with the
great Cullinan diamond from the Transvaal in November
1907. This diamond weighs one pound and one-third
(avoirdupois)&mdash;more than 21 oz. I have placed a good
glass model of it in the Central Hall of the Natural
History Museum; in the case with it is a glass model
of another big diamond, the “Excelsior,” as now cut,
and also models of the “Pitt” diamond, in the rough
and in the cut condition. Diamonds lose enormously
in the process of cutting. The Excelsior, like the
Cullinan, is a Cape diamond of fine quality, and free
from colour. It was the biggest diamond known until
the giant Cullinan was found: in the rough it weighed
7 oz., or less than a third of the Cullinan. As now cut,
it only weighs <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">3</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> oz. It is reduced to a quarter of its
original size.</p>

<p>In the same way, the Pitt diamond, an Indian one,
named after General Pitt, of Madras, weighed originally
3 oz., and is now (it is in Paris, in the Louvre, and is
called “The Regent”) less than an ounce in weight.
The biggest Indian diamond known&mdash;the Nizam&mdash;is not
quite twice this size, whilst the Kohinoor, which is
probably a fragment (a third) of the “Great Mogul”&mdash;a
diamond which has disappeared, leaving only tradition<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
and surmises as to its history&mdash;weighs no more than
three-quarters of an ounce. This seems a small affair
by the side of the twenty-one ounces of the Cullinan.</p>

<p>No one can guess what will happen to the Cullinan
in cutting it. At the best, it may be reduced to
something between four and five ounces in weight, and
it may “fly” into fragments. It would be necessary
deliberately to cut it up into smaller stones in order to
obtain the full result of flashing of light and colour
which twenty-one ounces of diamond can produce. And
the operation of cutting and polishing is enormously
expensive. One would have hoped that Sir William
Crookes and other men of science would have been
asked to examine this wonderful mass of transparent
carbon by means of polarised light, Röntgen rays, and
radium, and to determine exactly its specific gravity
before it was broken up. Indeed, it would probably
have retained its greatest interest and value if never
cut at all.</p>

<p>Glass or “paste,” as it is called, is made which cannot
when new be distinguished from diamond by anyone but an
expert, armed with the necessary tests. And the same is
true as to paste imitations of all precious stones excepting
the emerald (whose beautiful green tint cannot be
exactly obtained), the cat’s-eye, which has a peculiar
fibrous structure, and the opal. The real value and
quality of precious stones, as compared with glass,
depends on their durability, their hardness, their
resistance to scratching, and “dulling” of face and
edge. Even our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, as may be
seen in the fine collection recently dug up at Ipswich
by Miss Layard, and placed in the old house serving
as the municipal museum there, made gems of glass
and paste. In modern times the art of making artificial
“precious stones” has reached a degree of perfection
which, so far as decorative purposes are concerned,
leaves the natural stones no claim to superiority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>Gigantic as the Cullinan diamond is, it represents
only about half the daily output of the De Beers mines.
By the end of 1904 ten tons of diamonds, valued at
£60,000,000 sterling, had been removed from the
Kimberley mines. It is difficult to imagine what has
become of them all, and since they are, unlike paste,
durable and permanent, how the demand for additions
to those in use, keeps up. Twelve years ago about four
million pounds was spent annually by the public on the
purchase of diamonds. It is stated that the annual
demand and expenditure are now even larger.</p>

<p>Diamond is a peculiar form or variety of the chemical
element carbon&mdash;a very peculiar form most people will
say who remember that charcoal and lamp-black are the
common form of carbon. That one and the same
unchangeable chemical element can exist as an
amorphous black lump or powder, and also without
addition or loss of chemical constituents, as the clearest,
hardest, and most brilliant of crystals, is a paradox.
The same strange capacity for existing in two totally
different forms is exhibited by other fairly familiar
elements. Sulphur is found in tertiary water-deposited
clays in Sicily (it has nothing to do with Etna or
Vesuvius) in the form of clear, lemon-coloured crystals
half an inch or more in length. If you take some
commercial stick-sulphur and melt it in a porcelain
spoon, and pour half the melted stuff like treacle into a
jar of water, you will find that it cools as translucent
threads which are pliable and soft. The other half
which you leave in the spoon to cool shoots out into the
form of long brittle crystals of a needle-like shape.
These two varieties of sulphur are nearly as different as
lamp-black and diamond.</p>

<p>Diamonds are found at the Cape in a “blue ground”
which is of volcanic origin, formed by the action of
steam under enormous pressure. The blue volcanic
mud has been thrust up from great depths in the earth’s<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
surface in the form of “pipes” 100 yards to half a mile
in diameter. It has long been known that at very high
temperatures (4,000 deg. Centigrade) the metal iron
dissolves carbon. The late Professor Moissan, of Paris,
obtained artificial diamonds by suddenly cooling the
iron in which carbon was dissolved by plunging the
crucible into water. The outer shell of iron cools and
forms a tightly closed shell enclosing the still liquid
core. As this core cools it tends to expand, and thus
produces an enormous pressure. The melted carbon
cooling under this pressure assumes the crystalline
colourless form known as diamond. There is good
reason to believe that diamonds are formed, or have
been formed, in association with metallic iron in a
similar way, on a large scale, in great depths of the
earth’s crust, and are shot up to the surface with other
débris in the volcanic steam mud which is the “blue
ground.”</p>

<p>A few diamonds of small size have been found in the
Ural Mountains, otherwise they are not natural products
of the northern hemisphere. It is in India, Australia,
South America, and South Africa that they are picked
up, either in beds of streams, or in peculiar volcanic mud,
or embedded in even harder rock. Many are in a
condition of severe strain when found, and contain
minute cavities filled with liquid carbonic acid. They
are liable, in consequence, to break or even fly into
powder when warmed by the hand or struck. Though
usually colourless, diamonds may be yellow, green, blue,
or red, and the rays of radium cause colourless diamonds
to become coloured. Some diamonds, but not all, are
phosphorescent&mdash;that is to say, like the well-known
luminous paint&mdash;after exposure to strong light they
acquire the power of shining themselves for a certain
time when removed to a dark chamber. And the
curious thing is that, though themselves colourless, some
give out blue, some green, some yellow, and some red<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
light. The most wonderful, however, in this respect are
the rare diamonds which become luminous merely by
rubbing, and leave phosphorescent streaks on the cloth
with which they are rubbed. This property is similar
to the phosphorescence shown by other kinds of crystals
when heated or when simply fractured.</p>

<p>Diamonds are readily distinguished from paste by the
Röntgen rays, since they are transparent to those rays,
whilst paste (or glass) is opaque to them. Radium also
causes diamonds, but not paste, to phosphoresce. All
diamonds are not equally hard, though they are the
hardest of stones, and harder than steel, but not harder
than the metal tantalum. Some Australian diamonds
are known (from Inverel, New South Wales) which are
so hard that at one time they could not be cut and
polished; but only four years ago the rapidity of the
wheels used in these processes was greatly increased, and
these terribly hard diamonds were brought into subjection.</p>

<p>Thus it is clear that there are many extraordinary
features of interest about the diamond, and that its
brilliance and high price constitute only a small part of
its fascination.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_10">10. <em>Science and Fisheries</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Science, the knowledge of the vast system of orderly,
inexorable activities under which we exist, and of which
we, and all that we can apprehend, are but more or less
significant parts, is not only to be regarded as a gratification
of our curiosity, as food for our imagination, and
the basis of our philosophical theories. It is, in addition
to these, a thing of unparalleled importance to the
immediate daily welfare of every man, woman, and
child, and upon its due cultivation and use depend the
future welfare, even the existence, of whole races of<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
mankind. It is a startling fact that so few of those who
undertake to lead and to legislate for the people of this
country have any real conviction, or even a dim understanding
of this truth.</p>

<p>In November 1906 a Committee appointed by the
Government took evidence as to the desirability of
continuing the international investigation of the North
Sea, upon which Great Britain entered five years ago in
conjunction with other Northern States. Only a few
weeks before, a number of scientific experts engaged in
this study of the North Sea, with a view to gaining
such knowledge of that great “waste of waters” as may
help the nations of adjacent lands to draw from it stores
of food without destroying the source or recklessly
injuring the supply, were entertained at dinner, at the
Guildhall, by the City Fathers, and treated to speeches
by hereditary legislators. The view expressed by these
speakers was that the interests of the great fishing
industry and of the fish trade were best understood by
the practical fisherman. Science was a “handmaid,”
useful in her place, but not to be permitted to undermine
established interests and the hoary wisdom of the
practical man, her employer. A German expert of
high official position, one of the guests, took a different
line. He was astonished, even shocked, that Great
Britain, the State most largely concerned in the North
Sea fisheries, should be hesitating about continuing to
take part in the international investigation. In Germany,
he said, they took a different course in such matters.
Men of business and practical legislators, when called
upon to deal with an important problem, sought first of
all for scientific knowledge of the conditions in question,
as complete and thorough as possible, and then
proceeded to act upon the sure foundation gained.
More knowledge, much more knowledge as to the causes
and conditions at work in regard to the life and movements
of fishes in the North Sea was needed. The work<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
of the International Committee must be continued, and
his (the German) Government would certainly continue
to do its share of the work.</p>

<p>The contrast in the British and the German attitude
towards science is what is interesting in this episode. It
is true that men of science in this country have to be
content to take a very modest part in public affairs, and
to allow politicians and self-styled “practical” men to
treat science as “a handmaiden”&mdash;thankful when science
is not regarded as an enemy. But they know well
enough, and those who are really “practical men” know,
that science is no handmaiden, but in reality the
master&mdash;the master who must be obeyed; who alone can
give true guidance; who alone can save the State. The
sooner and the more thoroughly the people of this
country have recognised this fact, and insist upon its
unqualified acceptance in practice by their representatives
and governors, the better for them and their posterity.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_11">11. <em>Discoveries as to Malaria</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Recent scientific work, discovery, and application to
practical affairs of the results of discovery, in regard to
three great obstacles to human life and prosperity
illustrate the vital importance to the state of scientific
research. The obstacles in question are the diseases
known as malaria, yellow fever, and Mediterranean,
or Malta fever. It is now twenty-five years since
Dr. Laveran, of Paris, discovered that malaria, or ague,
is caused by a very minute parasite which exists in the
red blood corpuscles of those stricken with the fever,
and suggested that it is probably carried from victim to
victim by blood-sucking mosquitoes (gnats). Major
Ross, of the Indian Army, who has been rewarded for
his discovery by the Nobel prize, determined to find<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
out what gnat it is which carries the malaria-germ from
man to man, and by most persevering experiment and
microscopic examination showed that it is not the
commoner gnat or mosquito (Culex), but the spot-winged
kind (Anopheles), which alone can spread the malarial
infection. But Major Ross is, before everything else, a
medical man, and his great purpose has been to apply
his discovery to the prevention of disease.</p>

<p>Whole regions of the earth’s surface are rendered
dangerous, or even uninhabitable, for civilised men by
malaria; in other words, by the Anopheles mosquito.
Accordingly, Ross set to work to find the best means of
destroying these agents of disease. He found that the
Anopheles gnat breeds in natural collections of water
lying upon the surface of the ground in open country,
and not as many common varieties of gnats do, in
vessels and cisterns in houses. The pools frequented
by the malaria-carrying gnat are small and easily
drained. The obvious direction of science, therefore,
was to remove or to cover up these pools wherever they
were found in the neighbourhood of human habitations.
Although Major Ross made his discoveries in India,
and although he opened a campaign against malaria by
removal of surface pools in the Colonies of West
Africa&mdash;“the white man’s grave”&mdash;twice visiting the
chief British settlements&mdash;only half-hearted, incomplete
measures have been taken, insufficient funds have been
expended, and a supine executive and half-incredulous
officials have failed to do more than partially reduce the
prevalence of malaria in those regions. On the other
hand, where intelligent officials have understood and
accepted the clear results of science in regard to malaria,
the most striking and satisfactory consequences have
followed.</p>

<p>At Ismailia, on the Suez Canal, malaria was almost
universal; in 1866 there were in a population of eight
thousand, 2,300 cases. In 1897 there were over 2,000,<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
and in 1902, when Ross was asked by the Prince d’Arenberg
to visit the place and advise as to measures to be
taken, there were 1,551 cases. Ross directed the filling
up of the breeding pools. The marshes were filled up with
sand, the irrigation channels were deepened or treated
with kerosene oil (which spreads as a fine film, and chokes
the gnat larvæ), and the cess-pits were rendered uninhabitable
by chemical treatment. In one year the cases
of malaria fell to 214, in 1905 they were only thirty-seven,
and now the Suez Canal Company officially reports,
“all trace of malaria has disappeared from Ismailia.”
The same satisfactory results have been obtained in Port
Said, in Khartoum, in Port Swettenham of the Federated
Malay States, in Havannah City, in Panama, and, in
fact, wherever intelligent conviction has led to the active
and complete employment of the methods necessary for
the destruction of the gnats. Under the British Government
of India and the African and West India
Colonies, little has been done. Why? Because of the
handmaiden theory and the ostrich-like refusal of our
officials to face and accept the master.</p>

<p>An even more wonderful and beneficent result has
been obtained in the case of that terrible disease “Yellow
Jack,” or “Black Vomit”&mdash;the yellow fever. Owing to
the discoveries and definite proof by Ross as to the part
played by gnats in malaria, the able medical men in the
public service of the United States of America have
thoroughly examined experimentally the mode of infection
of human beings with the germ of yellow fever, and
have conclusively proved that infection is solely and entirely
due to the bite of one species of gnat&mdash;the
Stegomyia fasciata. They have proved to absolute
certainty that yellow fever is not carried through the
air, nor by food or drink, nor by contact with infected
persons or their cloths or emanations, but only by the
fasciate gnat, a house-frequenting species, which sucks
the blood of a yellow fever patient, and after twelve<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
days, and not till then, becomes capable of imparting
the infection to those whom it may stab or “bite.”
The firm demonstration of this fact was not made without
great devotion, courage, and self-sacrifice. In the
ardour of their pursuit not a few of the experimenters
risked and lost their lives. Among these the name of
Dr. Lazear, of the United States Army, is prominent.
He deliberately permitted himself to be bitten by a stray
mosquito in a yellow fever hospital, in order to
show that the insect could convey the infection. He
was bitten on Sept. 13, 1900, and died on Sept. 25,
having proved his point.</p>

<p>The actual germ, microbe, or minute parasitic organism
which causes yellow fever, and is carried by the fasciate
gnat, has not yet been detected. Nevertheless, without
seeing and isolating the microbe, the medical men of
America (Sternberg, Finlay, Carroll, and others) have,
by destroying the gnat and preventing its access to
men&mdash;especially to patients already infected, and, therefore,
certain to infect the gnats and cause them to
spread the disease&mdash;practically made an end of yellow
fever in many great cities of the New World, where it
was only six years ago an ever-present horror, striking
men down with a suddenness and with a deadliness
which paralysed human activity. Here, as in other
cases, intelligent appreciation of the results of science
by a governor or a municipality has saved thousands of
lives. On the other hand, in Rio de Janeiro, “the
opposition encountered by the sanitary authorities of
the city from political factions and the ridicule to
which they were subjected by the local Press” were
insuperable (I quote from an official report), and so a
few more thousand lives were sacrificed before the
master was recognised and the proffered safety accepted.
In Vera Cruz, in New Orleans, and in Panama yellow
fever has been reduced to a vanishing quantity by
removing the pools and tanks in which the fasciate gnat<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
can breed, and by making use of wire-gauze to prevent
the access of mosquitoes to houses, bed-chambers, drains,
and baths, and especially to prevent not only their
access to, but their egress from, the rooms and beds of
patients already infected with disease.</p>

<p>In the city of Havannah, during the American
occupation of Cuba (1900-1903), Colonel Gorgas
reduced the death-rate due to yellow fever from an
annual average of 751 to so small a figure as six. The
same energetic and faithful administrator has been
at work, with even more remarkable results, in the
canal zone of the Isthmus of Panama since 1904. The
attempt of the French to cut the canal was foiled
chiefly by yellow fever and malaria. It is estimated
that their effort cost quite 50,000 lives. Assisted by
an able and enthusiastic staff, and charged with the task
by a Government which comprehends the fact that the
really “practical men” are the men who recognise
science as the master (not as the negligible eccentric
handmaid), Colonel Gorgas has banished the mosquito
from his zone of occupation. As a consequence there
is neither malaria nor yellow fever on the Panama
works. In 1906 the total death-rate amongst 5,000
white employés on the Panama Canal works was only
seven in the thousand. Further, in last April the
daily sick-rate of the total force of about 40,000
people was only seventeen in the thousand. Colonel
Gorgas declares that there is but little sickness of any
kind among the Americans in the employ of the Panama
Commission, and that they and their wives and children
are fully as vigorous and robust in appearance and in
fact, as the same number of people in the United States.
There is no reason why the centres of wealth, civilisation,
and population should not again be in the tropics, as
they were in the dawn of man’s history.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_12">12. <em>Malta Fever</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Mediterranean or Malta fever was for long confused
with typhoid and other fevers. Our soldiers and sailors
at Malta, Gibraltar, and Cyprus, as well as many
frequenters of the African and Asiatic shore, were
subject to this disease, and often incapacitated by it.
In 1887 Colonel David Bruce discovered in the blood of
patients the minute Micrococcus melitensis, which is its
cause, and established the fact that it is a definite
independent disease. The hospital at Malta has
received as many as 624 patients in a year suffering from
Malta fever from among the 8,000 soldiers on the island
and the 12,000 sailors on the Mediterranean Station.
And as they stay in hospital on an average for four
months, this means 74,880 days of illness. This means
a considerable loss to the State, as well as a large
amount of personal suffering terminated, in some cases
after two years’ sickness, by death.</p>

<p>The War Office, Admiralty, and Colonial Office
applied in 1904 to the Royal Society of London to
undertake a further investigation of this disease. The
society sent out a small commission, which has been at
work for three years, and has published seven volumes
of reports. The problem before the commission was to
discover the mode of infection by the Malta-fever germ
(the Micrococcus melitensis), and thus, if possible, to
arrive at a means of arresting the infection. Various
hypotheses, guesses as to probable and possible methods
of dissemination, were entertained and examined. As
the germ occurs in the blood, it was naturally considered
possible that gnats or other insects were the carrying
agent. But negative results followed all experiments in
this direction. Then it was found that the “germ”
passes out of the body in large quantities by the renal
secretion, and it was thought that it might be conveyed<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
in a dried form with dust in the air. This also proved
to be an incorrect supposition.</p>

<p>Next a very important discovery was made. The
germ was found in the blood and the excretions of 10
per cent. of the goats which are kept in Malta as the sole
source of milk, and are driven through the streets to
supply customers, whilst 50 per cent. of the goats were
found to have been infected at some time. Then the
germ was found in the milk itself, and it only remained
to prove by experiment that it was from the goats’ milk
that human beings acquire the infection. A monkey
fed with the milk of an infected goat acquired the
fever.</p>

<p>The next step was to stop the consumption of goats’
milk by the soldiers and sailors in the hospital and
barrack. Actually we were carefully feeding our invalid
soldiers and sailors in the great hospital at Valetta with
a highly poisonous infected fluid&mdash;the milk of the
Maltese goat! The preventive measure&mdash;the stoppage
of goats’ milk&mdash;only came into operation in July, 1906.
In the first six months of that year there were thirty-one
cases of Malta fever in every thousand of the
garrison (numbering about 8,000 men). In the
preceding six months there had been forty-seven cases
per thousand. Now when the goats’ milk was stopped
after July, 1906, what was the result? From July to
December, 1906, there were only ten cases per thousand
of the garrison. In actual numbers there were in July,
August, and September in 1905 as many as 258 cases,
whilst in the same months in 1906, after removal of
goats’ milk from the dietary of the troops, there were
only twenty-six cases, and these were probably due to the
independent purchase of goats’ milk by soldiers outside
the barracks. In the naval hospital until 1906 almost
every patient who remained in the hospital a few weeks
took the disease. Since the exclusion of goats’ milk
not a single case has occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>The Director-General of the Medical Department of
the Navy reports that there has been no case of Malta
fever during the year among the sailors, and only seven
cases among the soldiers up to the end of September,
1907.</p>

<p>Gibraltar had a fever of its own, identical with Malta
fever. It has now been shown that it was probably
introduced by the importation of goats from Malta
for the supply of milk. This is likely, because the
importation of Maltese goats ceased in 1883, and the
fever began to disappear from Gibraltar in 1885,
and finally vanished altogether in 1905.</p>

<p>In South Africa Malta-fever is common amongst the
white population. It is probable, according to Colonel
Birt, that it was introduced by means of infected
goats imported from the Mediterranean. The soldiers,
however, in South Africa are free from this disease,
excepting those who have already contracted it in the
Mediterranean, since in South Africa goats’ milk does
not enter into the dietary of the soldier. It is the
civilian population which suffers.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_13">13. <em>A Cure for Sleeping Sickness</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Diamonds and sleeping sickness are both special
African problems. It was owing to the proposal to
employ natives from Uganda in the South African
diamond mines that the Colonial Secretary (Mr. Chamberlain
at that date) asked the Royal Society to say
whether the sleeping sickness which had broken out
with terrible violence in Central Africa constituted an
obstacle to that employment, on account of the danger
of introducing the disease into South Africa. The
Royal Society advised the Government not to allow the
transport of natives from the infected districts of Uganda,
and sent out a commission to Central Africa to study<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
the disease. The result was the discovery by Colonel
Bruce of the parasite of sleeping sickness called Trypanosoma&mdash;a
kind previously known in some other
diseases&mdash;and of the fact that it is a tsetse-fly which
carries it. A quarter of a million natives have died
in Central Africa within the last six years from sleeping
sickness. The Tropical Diseases Committee of the
Royal Society has started an inquiry into the action of
drugs on the parasites (known as trypanosomes) which
cause sleeping sickness and the horse and cattle disease
of the “fly-belts” of South Africa.</p>

<p>The minute parasites which cause Malta, yellow, and
malarial fever, and other infections, are no doubt best
dealt with by excluding them from access to the human
body when that is possible. But once they have
effected a lodgment and commenced to multiply in the
blood or tissues, it is still possible to get at them by
means of drugs, which poison them without injuring
their human victim. Thus quinine has been of
enormous service in checking the ravages of the malaria
parasite, and really in Great Britain has exterminated
“ague,” which is the English name for malaria.
Many experiments have been made during the last two
years, with the view of finding some drug which will,
in like manner, destroy the trypanosomes which have
established themselves in the blood and lymph-passages
of the human body, and are slowly killing their victim
with sleeping sickness. An arsenic compound, “atoxyl,”
has been found effective when injected into the patient’s
body, and according to Dr. Koch, who returned last year
from Uganda, he has found nothing better than this
treatment, discovered by Dr. Thomas and Dr. Breinl,
of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, three
years ago. Dr. Plimmer and Dr. Thomson, who
have been experimenting in London for the Royal
Society, have found a drug which is more effective than
atoxyl in destroying certain trypanosomes which attack<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
rats, and is now being tried in the treatment of
sleeping sickness. This is the tartrate of sodium and
antimony&mdash;a salt corresponding to the well-known
tartar emetic, with this difference, that it contains
sodium instead of potassium. It seems that this
sodium variety of tartar emetic is very destructive to
trypanosomes in the blood and lymph, and has no
injurious effect of a lowering nature, such as occurs when
the potassium salt is used. As the antimony drug is
far cheaper than atoxyl, it will be possible to apply it
freely to horses and cattle suffering from “nagana” and
“surra,” which are diseases due to trypanosomes of a
special kind. Two white men who had become infected
by the trypanosome of sleeping sickness in West Africa
have been treated with the new drug in London, and
the parasites have completely disappeared from their
blood in consequence, though it remains to be seen
whether a permanent cure has been effected. One
cannot imagine a situation of more thrilling interest
than that existing in the nursing home where those two
victims were given a strong hope of escape from what
seemed to be certain death, whilst the fate of thousands
of African natives, similarly infected, was hanging in
the balance! After six months from the date of treatment
the report is satisfactory. The parasites have not
yet re-appeared (July, 1908) in the two patients treated
in November.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_14">14. <em>Tsetse-Flies and Disease</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Dr. Koch appears to have been questioned on his
return to Europe by some journalists as to the results of
his study of sleeping sickness during the past year and a
half in Uganda. It was already known (three years
ago), from the observations of Professor Minchin, Dr.
Gray, and Dr. Tulloch (the Royal Society’s observers<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
in Uganda), that the tsetse-fly in Uganda sucks the
blood of crocodiles, also of fishes and of hippopotami.
Dr. Koch confirms this observation. Minchin also observed
a trypanosome in the blood of the crocodile
differing from that of sleeping sickness. Whether crocodiles
help, in an important degree, to keep tsetse-flies
alive in the regions where they occur, by offering them
a ready meal of blood, is uncertain. So far as the
facts are known, they do not lead to the belief that
the crocodile is a “reservoir host” for the trypanosome
of sleeping sickness.</p>

<p>“Reservoir-host” is a very useful and expressive name
for animals which can tolerate or support a parasite in
their blood which is deadly to other animals. The
parasite flourishes in abundance in the reservoir-host
with entire satisfaction to both host and guest. But a
blood-sucking fly or gnat, of promiscuous tastes in the
matter of blood, comes along, sucks the reservoir-host a
bit, and then goes off for another meal to a susceptible
animal, into which it introduces the parasite now
adhering to its already blood-smeared proboscis or beak.
Such a history was first established by Bruce in regard
to the trypanosome parasite which causes the deadly
nagana disease in the “fly-belts” of South Africa. The
big game animals are reservoir-hosts to this parasite,
from which they are carried by the tsetse-fly to horses,
mules, and dogs, which, being of foreign origin, are not
tolerant of it, but are killed by the poison to which its
multiplication in their blood gives rise. Thus, too,
native children, both in Africa and the East Indies,
appear to be tolerant of the malaria parasite, and act as
reservoir-hosts from which the spot-winged gnats suck
and distribute the parasite to the non-tolerant, susceptible
adult natives and white men.</p>

<p>The tsetse-flies are little bigger than the common
house-fly, and bite, or rather stab, very rapidly after
alighting on the skin. The study of flies and gnats, and<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
other blood-sucking insects, has become extremely
important, and has been carried on with great energy by
many specialists since it became known that these insects
play such a terribly important part in the causation
of disease. At the Natural History Museum I received
(in response to a circular issued at my request by H.M.
Government) thousands of specimens of gnats (mosquitoes)
from all parts of the world, and some hundreds of
new species have been described in a series of volumes by
Professor F. V. Theobald, published by the trustees.
Other volumes are in preparation illustrating the blood-sucking
flies of various regions of the world, and one
concerning those of the British Islands has already
appeared. The common gnat, the spot-winged gnat,
and the tsetse-fly&mdash;as well as the microscopic parasites
causing malaria and sleeping sickness&mdash;are illustrated
by greatly enlarged models&mdash;very carefully executed
under my direction, which are exhibited in the central
hall of the museum.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the coloured races of men&mdash;especially
those of Africa&mdash;have little or no objection to
being bitten by flies. They seem to accept the attention
of flies and ticks with indifference. The men sleep
in the day under trees, and are willing food-supply to
the insects. The eyelids of children are literally
inhabited by flies in some countries, and the folds of
the skin of fat adults hide whole rows of fast-holding
ticks. But the white man does not willingly permit
either fly, flea, or gnat to settle on him. He is (or has
been), nevertheless, unwisely tolerant of house-flies in
his habitations, and the poorer and less cleanly population
are in large proportion infested with wingless
insects. The newly established knowledge that certain
flies (glossina or tsetse-fly) are the carriers of sleeping
sickness, that gnats are the carriers of malaria and of
yellow fever, that fleas are the carriers of the plague,
and that certain kinds of ticks are the carriers of cattle-fevers<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
and dog-fevers, and probably of some obscure
fevers of man, must make us all more anxious than we
were about contact with insect life. For ages popular
tradition has ascribed diseases of one kind and another
in various parts of the world to the bites of flies. But
actually it is little more than fifty years ago since it was
really shown that deadly germs or parasites existed
which could be, and actually are, carried by flies from
one animal to another, and introduced into the blood by
the flies’ stab. This was first shown in regard to the
bacterium of splenic fever (or anthrax, or wool-sorters’
disease), a blood-disease of cattle which is transferred
by the big, fiercely-biting “horse-flies” (tabanus), from
animals to man, and is invariably fatal. Another
bacterial disease, “pernicious œdema,” is inflicted on
man in the same way. These cases were exceptional, and
it is only quite recently that the agency of flies and fleas
in great epidemics, and in diseases causing thousands
of deaths every year in well-known regions, has been
discovered.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_15">15. <em>Monkeys and Fleas</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The wingless parasites known as pediculi are not
known as active agents in spreading disease germs, probably
because they do not readily transfer themselves
from one animal to another. It is in this connection a
really remarkable fact that monkeys are not infested by
fleas, and that only in few cases and not in many kinds
have pediculi or acari been observed. In this respect the
lower races of men (and even the higher) seem to have
fallen away from a grade of excellence attained by their
despised quadrumanous cousins. When this fact as to
the freedom of monkeys from insect parasites is mentioned,
those who have watched monkeys in captivity
will immediately say, “Surely I have seen monkeys<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
carefully picking insects from one another’s fur.” The
fact is that it is this very habit of “picking” which
prevents monkeys from harbouring fleas. Whereas a
dog or a cat can only scratch, the monkey has an
opposible thumb and delicately sensitive fingers. That
which has become the hand of man, with all its marvellous
skill and efficiency, has been elaborated in its early
stages as a means for keeping the hair clean. When
monkeys are seen carefully removing something with finger
and thumb from their own or their companion’s hair, it
is not an insect but a little piece of fatty secretion and
scurf which is thus removed. The habit, which seems to
be general in all kinds of monkeys, even with the
anthropoids, such as the chimpanzee and the orang, has
of course been efficient in removing any parasitic insects
which may at one time have infested monkeys&mdash;all
other furry animals are liberally supplied with them, as
also are birds&mdash;but is now preventive of any re-establishment
of such visitors. The popular judgment of the
monkey’s habit is similar to that of the Japanese Aino,
who remarked to a traveller who arranged to have a
bath in his room every day that he must be a very
dirty man to require it.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_16">16. <em>The Jigger Flea</em></h2>
</div>


<p>One flea is recorded as having been once taken on
an anthropoid ape (a gorilla), and is the “jigger,” Pulex
penetrans. This is a very serious pest, the history of
which shows how man himself opens up the path by
which dangerous diseases spread. The jigger-flea was
originally known only in the South American tropics.
It spread from there to the West Indies in the last
century. It burrows into the skin, usually between the
toes, but elsewhere also, and causes an abscess and sore
as big and deep as a hazel-nut. Several such cavities at<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
a time are dangerous, and often lead to blood-poisoning
and death. Europeans avoid the burrowing of the
jigger by having their toes carefully examined every
morning, but black men are less careful. From the
West Indies, about thirty years ago, the jigger was
carried in ships to West Africa. There it flourished and
spread from village to village across Central Africa,
decimating the population. It appears to have been
carried to a large extent by dogs, in whose skin it
flourishes. It has now passed through Africa to India,
and we shall no doubt soon hear of its having completed
the circuit of the globe.</p>

<p>A great many kinds of fleas are known, many furry
animals having their own special species, which does not
leave them to take up its dwelling on other kinds of
animal. The common rat has a large flea of its own,
which apparently is not the flea which carries the plague
from rats to men. It is a “wandering” flea which does
this, namely, the Cheops flea. This flea, common in
the East but unknown in colder regions, does not stay
as one could wish it to do&mdash;on the rat; but travels
about visiting human beings and dogs, and so carries
the plague bacillus from rats to men. In the absence
of these fleas plague would be a rat-disease unknown
in men. It is probable that we do not nowadays live so
thoroughly cheek-by-jowl with rats in Western Europe
as formerly, so that even if rats infected with plague
and harbouring the Eastern Cheops flea arrive in our
docks, the wandering flea is too far off to reach us in
our modern houses.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_17">17. <em>Public Estimate of the Value of Science</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The Royal Society, the full title of which is The
Royal Society of London for the Promotion of Natural
Knowledge, has its anniversary meeting and dinner on<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
St. Andrew’s Day. The health of the medallists of the
year 1907 was given from the chair by Lord Rayleigh,
and they replied one by one to the toast. Professor
Michelsen, of Chicago, received what is considered the
greatest honour the society has to bestow&mdash;the Copley
Medal (founded more than two hundred years ago) for his
researches on light. He related in his speech how he had
tried to interest a wealthy business man in the experiments
going on in his laboratory, in the hope that his
friend might be moved to give pecuniary aid for the
provision of new apparatus. One by one, he showed
his delicate instruments and explained their uses; no
impression was produced. At last he explained how
the bright lines of the spectrum of flame, coloured by
incandescent elements (such as theatre-goers know as
red fire, green fire, blue fire, &amp;c.), can be recognised by
means of the spectroscope in the light of the sun&mdash;proving
the presence of the metals and other elements
of this earth in that remote body. He especially explained
and showed his friend the experiments by which
sodium, the metal of which caustic soda is the “rust,”
is thus proved to be present in the sun. At last his
friend spoke. He said: “Who the &mdash;&mdash; cares if there
is sodium in the sun?” Professor Michelsen did not
tell the fellows of the Royal Society how he replied to
that abrupt inquiry.</p>

<p>A more encouraging speech was that of Lord Fitzmaurice,
the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, who replied to the toast of the guests. He
declared, in so many words, “It is every day becoming
more and more certain that science is the master.” He
said that in his own business as a diplomatist he found
that the chief matters which he had to discuss and
decide depended on scientific knowledge and the information
and guidance given to him and his colleagues
by scientific men. In the beginning of the eighteenth
century the British Government had sent a bishop and<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
a poet to negotiate the Treaty of Utrecht. But neither
would be of any use in modern diplomacy. What they
always had to seek at the present day was the aid of
the scientific departments of the Navy or the Army, or
of the Royal Society. Such matters as the relative
merits of a Channel tunnel or a Channel ferry, the
limitations of territory by land, by sea, or above the
land in the air, the international agreements as to
measures for checking the spread of disease or of insect
pests, and, indeed, most matters which had come before
him since he had been in office, had to be decided by
the scientific experts. He did not propose that diplomatists
should at once vacate their posts and endeavour
to secure the occupation of them by men of science, but
he thought that at no distant date such a course would
be considered not only reasonable, but necessary!</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_18">18. <em>The Common House-fly and Others</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The common house-fly is not so innocent as he looks,
but really a dirty little thing. He has not a sharp
beak-like proboscis, and cannot stab, but he has a soft,
dabbing proboscis, which he pushes on to every kind of
filth as well as walking with his six legs on such matter.
Then he comes and wipes off minute particles and
germs on to our food, our lips, our fingers, and faces.
It is quite certain that he, and others allied to him, are
thus the means of spreading typhoid fever in camps
where there are open latrines and open larders and mess
tables. The house-fly breeds from a maggot, just as
the blue-bottle or blow-fly does, but very few people
have ever seen or recognised the maggot of the house-fly.
The reason is that it lays its eggs in horse dung,
and the grubs are hatched in the muck-heaps of stables.
That is also the reason why it is much less numerous in<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
London than it used to be, since stables and mews are
now fewer and cleaner than they were. It is also the
reason why the house-fly abounds in ill-kept country
inns and farmhouses. Its breeding ground is just outside
the window.</p>

<p>There is not only one common house-fly in this
country: there are three kinds, in addition to the blue-bottle
or blow-fly, which is distinguished at once by its
great size and blue colour, and lays its eggs in carrion.
Late in the year you may often see what would pass for
young or starveling house-flies going about among the
others. This is a distinct species, the Homalomyia
canicularis of entomologists. The third kind only to
be distinguished by careful examination with the aid of
a magnifying glass, is Anthomyia radicum. Both these
are much less abundant than the common house-fly
(Musca domestica), with which they almost always
occur. Their breeding habits are similar to those of
the common house-fly.</p>

<p>A fourth kind of fly is invariably mistaken for the
common house-fly when it is noticed, as it sometimes is,
in consequence of the sharp stab which it inflicts. As
recently as the beginning of November last year I was
“bitten” or pricked by one of this fourth kind in a
London club. They are common enough on the sea
shore in autumn, and may be a severe nuisance. People
generally take them for common house-flies which have
lost their temper in the hot weather and give way to
the bad habit of “biting” out of sheer exasperation.
Really, of course, a house-fly could not stab or prick
with its broad-ended proboscis. The fly in question,
which looks almost exactly like a well-grown house-fly,
but possesses a sharp and business-like beak or proboscis,
is known to scientific men as Stomoxys calcitrans.
There are many kinds of Stomoxys scattered all over
the world, and it is probable, though not actually
proved, that they carry parasites such as the trypanosomes<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
of horse and cattle diseases from one animal to
another, as do the species of Glossina or tsetse-fly.</p>

<p>But we have yet to learn more about these flies and
the parasites they transfer. In the case of the gnat, it
has been discovered that the malaria parasite is swallowed
by the gnat, and multiplies in it, producing
thousands of spores in its blood, and it is these spores
which the gnat hands or rather “mouths” on to man.
No such multiplication of the trypanosome in the tsetse-fly
(Glossina) is known. The tsetse-fly passes on the
trypanosome as it received it, and yet it seems as
though it is not any and every biting fly which can pass
on the trypanosome of nagana, or of sleeping sickness,
but only the particular species of tsetse-fly. Perhaps
it is a case of greater abundance, the tsetse-flies being
the obvious and dangerous carriers of trypanosome
disease where they occur, on account of their abundance
and the fierceness and celerity of their attack. It is
almost certain that in India, Burma, and South America
some other flies must transfer the trypanosomes from
animal to animal, causing the diseases known as surra
and mal de caderas, because no tsetse-flies&mdash;that is to
say, no flies of the genus Glossina&mdash;occur in those
countries, and no other mode of transference, except by
some blood-sucking insect, seems probable.</p>

<p>Ants in Africa are carriers of infection, and possibly
also in London kitchens, where a little red ant sometimes
abounds. The black beetle or cockroach is a
creature to be got rid of, as it is very probable that it
spreads certain kinds of infection over food and dishes
during the hours of “revelry by night” which kind-hearted
people allow it to enjoy in their kitchens.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_19">19. <em>Cerebral Inhibition</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The best golf-player does not think, as he plays his
stroke, of the hundred-and-one muscular contractions
which, accurately co-ordinated, result in his making a
fine drive or a perfect approach; nor does the pianist
examine the order of movement of his fingers. His
“sub-liminal self,” his “unconscious cerebration,” attends
to these details without his conscious intervention, and
all the better for the absence of what the nerve-physiologists
call “cerebral inhibition”&mdash;that is to say, the
delay or arrest due to the sending round of the message
or order to the muscles by way of the higher brain-centres,
instead of letting it go directly from a lower
centre without the intervention of the seats of attention
and consciousness. The sneezing caused in most people
by a pinch of ordinary snuff can be rendered impossible
by “cerebral inhibition,” set up by a wager with the
snuff-taking victim that he will fail to sneeze in three
minutes, however much snuff he may take. His attention
to the mechanism of the anticipated sneeze, and his desire
for it, inhibit the whole apparatus. So long as you can
make him anxious to sneeze and fix his attention on the
effort to do so, by a judicious exhortation at intervals,
he will not succeed in sneezing. When the three
minutes are up, and you both have ceased to be interested
in the matter, he will probably sneeze unexpectedly
and sharply. I was set on to this train of thought by
a recent visit to an exhibition of photographs.</p>

<p>There were many very interesting illustrations of the
application of photography to scientific investigation.
Among others I saw a fine enlarged photograph of the
common millipede (Julus terrestris), and my desire was
renewed to have a bioscopic film-series of the movements
of this creature’s legs. Some years ago I attempted
to analyse, and published an account of, the regular<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
rhythmic movement of the legs of millipedes. I found
that the “phases” of forward and backward swing are
presented in groups of twelve pairs of legs, each pair of
legs being in the same phase of movement as the twelfth
pair beyond it. But instantaneous photography would
give complete certainty about the movement in this case,
and in the case of the even more beautiful “rippling”
movement of the legs of some of the marine worms.
Some kindly photographer might take up the investigation
and prepare a series of films. The problem is
raised and the effects of “cerebral inhibition” described
in a little poem which I am told we owe to the author
of “Lorna Doone.” As it is not widely known, I give
it here as a record of “cerebral inhibition”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“A centipede was happy ’til
</div><div class="indent0">One day a toad in fun
</div><div class="indent0">Said, ‘Pray which leg moves after which?’
</div><div class="indent0">This raised her doubts to such a pitch
</div><div class="indent0">She fell exhausted in the ditch,
</div><div class="indent0">Not knowing how to run.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The point, of course, is that she could execute the
complex movement of her legs well enough until her
brain was set to work and her conscious attention given
to the matter. Then “cerebral inhibition” took place
and she broke down.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_20">20. <em>Colour-photography and Photographs of Mars</em></h2>
</div>


<p>There were admirable photographs of wild birds and
their nests, and of insects and plants in this exhibition.
I saw the new Lumière coloured transparent photographs
thrown by a lantern on the screen, and could distinguish
the dots of red, green, and violet colour on what, at a
little distance, appeared to be a brilliantly white part of
the picture (the shirt collar of a “sitter”), just as one<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
sees a mosaic of coloured dots in the blazing sunlight of
the pictures painted by the French school of so-called
“vibristes” (Monod and others). Perhaps the most remarkable
of these photographs was a set of prints from
untouched photographs of the planet Mars, executed in
July 1907 by Professor Perceval Lowell at his observatory
in Arizona.</p>

<p>The Mars photographs are each about as big as a
dried pea (that is the biggest size possible with the
feeble light reflected by Mars), but “several of the
canals,” says Mr. Lowell, “are distinctly visible on the
photographs, and one has been photographed double.”
I should have liked to examine these photographs in a
good light with a lens. The statement quoted means
that the canals in Mars can no longer be regarded as due
to errors of eyesight and imagination, and that the
annual doubling or formation of a second canal parallel
to what was earlier in the year a single canal, is actually
recorded by a disinterested, impartial photographic plate.
Are these canals the work of intelligent inhabitants of
Mars? I will not venture to say in reply more than
this, that I have never heard any other explanation of
their occurrence. But that, of course, still leaves the
matter open.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_21">21. <em>Origin of Names by Errors in Copying</em></h2>
</div>


<p>A curious illustration of a mistake perpetuated by a
clerical error is the title of Viscount Glerawly. The
title was intended to have been Glenawly, but the bad
writing of a clerk converted the “n” into an “r,” and
the name having been so entered in the patent of
nobility, or some such document, could not be altered.
The same thing has happened to the mammoth. His
proper native name is “mammont,” but “mont” became<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
“mout,” and then “moth.” A similar clerical error is
responsible for the name Gavial, which is applied to the
long, narrow-nosed crocodile of India, both as a scientific
name (Gavialis) and colloquially. Really the “v”
is due to a misreading of an “r,” the creature’s native
name being Garial. It was so written down and sent
home by an early explorer, but his handwriting being
wanting in clearness, the word was copied as Gavial and
the scientific patent issued in that name.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_22">22. <em>False News as to Extinct Monsters</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The tendency of English newspapers to bedeck themselves
every now and again with rank absurdities copied
from American rubbish-sheets is a disease. On no subject
outside the field of natural history and medicine
would any editor dream of printing the stuff which
does duty as “news” in regard to these departments&mdash;stuff
which has not even the semblance of being carefully
concocted, but yet is found “good enough” to
circulate as serious information.</p>

<p>Another antediluvian monster, much larger than the
mammoth, was reported in a London evening paper at
the end of November 1907. The article devoted to it
is a mass of absurdity, a burlesque of a genuine note on
the subject. It appears that the most ordinary thing
happened at Los Angeles, California, namely, that some
workmen, in driving a tunnel, unearthed some fossil
bones. We are not surprised to learn (though it is
announced as a marvel) that the bones were those of
a mastodon (of which you may see a whole skeleton
in Cromwell-road), and those of the extinct American
elephant called Elephas columbi. This very commonplace
occurrence was certainly not worth recording in a
London daily paper. So it is elaborately dressed up<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
with details intended to “fetch” the innocent reader.
The writer says Elephas columbi is as much larger than
the Siberian mammoth as that is larger than the horse
of to-day. The truth is that Elephas columbi and the
mammoth are as nearly as possible of the same size.
To writer goes on to tell of a “fossil horse,” found at
the same place, “a wonderful two-toed animal marked
by his cloven hoof.” That is cool impudence; it is precisely
“the double hoof” which none of the horse tribe
possess, but all the deer, cattle, and sheep do. He next
tells us that elephants and mastodons were never found
together before, but supposed to have shunned each
other’s company. This is an invention; their remains
are found side by side all over Europe. Then suddenly
the surprising statement is made, like a bolt from the
blue, “England ceases to be the Mother Country and
Germany the Fatherland to us,” and the pre-eminence
of America in providing the biggest thing on earth is
declared to have been already manifest “when the world
rose out of chaos.” It is satisfactory to be told that
England is not the Mother Country of this silliness;
but whether the world which solemnly prints and reads
it can be said to have yet “risen out of chaos” must be
regarded as doubtful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_23">23. <em>Mistletoe and Holly</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Christmas things and customs comprise much that
has great interest from a scientific point of view. Our
modern celebration of Christmas in England is a
combination of the Christian festival of the Nativity
with that of the Epiphany, and that of St. Nicholas,
who long ago was substituted for the sea god Neptune,
of classical mythology, by sea-faring folk. Santa Claus&mdash;or
Saint Nicholas&mdash;has his festival at the beginning
of December, but he has been carried over to Christmas<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
Day, and appears as “Father Christmas” in
modern celebrations. There is no great antiquity about
this part of the tradition which we try to keep alive
at Christmas. The making of Christmas Day and Christmastide
into a special children’s festival is, on the other
hand, a moving back of the festival of the Epiphany,
when gifts were brought to the child Christ by wise
men of the East. In Rome I have assisted in celebrating
our Twelfth Night under the name “Befani,” at a
great illuminated public fair, near the Pantheon, where
children are taken to buy toys.</p>

<p>There has been in England also a similar moving
back of the very ancient&mdash;even prehistoric&mdash;celebrations
of the New Year to Christmas, and hence it is that the
mysterious and sacred “mistletoe” of the Druids is
mingled in our houses with the less significant but
beautiful holly as a decoration. The Christian Church,
however, did not, and does not, sanction the introduction
of mistletoe into the sacred edifice, and not many years
ago those who loved and truly understood tradition
would not permit mistletoe to be mixed with holly even
in the private house at Christmastide. Mistletoe, it
was held, could not be rightly introduced until the new
year. The new year, however, of the Druids differed in
date from that of the later calendar, and fell in what is
to us the second week of March.</p>

<p>The holly tree, with its splendid red berries and
shining, prickly leaves, is a beautiful decorative plant,
very hardy and abundant: it was used by the old
Romans in their “Saturnalia,” a feast which nearly
coincided with the Christmas of the new religion.
There is a species of holly in South America the leaves
of which are made into tea by the Indians, the Paraguay
tea or matté. This tea is an unpleasant, bitter
decoction, devoid of aroma, if I may judge from samples
which I have tasted in London. “Ilex” is the
botanical name of the genus to which both our holly-tree<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
and the Paraguay tea belong, but it must not be
confused with the evergreen oak to which the name
Quercus ilex is given on account of the resemblance of
its leaves to those of a holly.</p>

<p>The mistletoe (or mistil-tan, the pale branch, in
Anglo-Saxon) is a pale-coloured, small-flowered member
of a great family of parasitic plants, the Loranthaceæ.
They all live upon trees, and draw a part of their
nourishment from the juices of the tree into which their
rootlets penetrate. The tropical allies of the mistletoe
are very beautiful plants, with fine bunches of brilliantly-coloured
flowers and broad handsome green leaves.
Our mistletoe is most commonly found parasitic on
apple trees and poplar trees. It occurs on nearly all
our trees, but is very rare on the oak. A careful
inquiry some time ago resulted in the discovery of only
seven oaks in all England on which mistletoe was
growing. The Druids took their sacred mistletoe from
the sacred oak tree on account of its rarity. To them
it was a charm against infertility and sterility, and,
according to Pliny, was cut and distributed at the new
year with great ceremony and the sacrifice of heifers.
Its paired white berries contain a viscid fluid which
gives it its botanical name Viscum album&mdash;and causes
the seeds to adhere to the beaks of birds&mdash;and thus to
be transported to a distance and introduced by the
birds’ attempts to wipe their beaks into the cracks of
the bark of trees, in which the seeds germinate.</p>

<p>The white-berried mistletoe is the only English kind,
and red mistletoe seems altogether out of character.
But a red-berried species (Viscum cruciatum) is parasitic
on the olive tree in Spain, North Africa, and Syria.
Curiously enough, though the white-berried mistletoe is
excommunicated by the Western Christian Church
on account of its use in pagan worship, the red-berried
mistletoe was gathered from olive trees in the Garden of
Gethsemane and in the enclosure of the Holy Sepulchre<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
at Jerusalem by Sir Joseph Hooker, the great botanist.
The red-berried mistletoe was successfully raised from
seed on young olive trees six years ago in this country
by the Hon. Charles Ellis, of Frensham, near
Haslemere, and was figured at that time by Hooker.</p>

<p>The mistletoe has an evil name in Scandinavian
mythology. Baldur, the beautiful, the Sun-god, was
made, like Achilles, invulnerable to spears and arrows
cut from whatever tree grows on earth. All things had
taken an oath not to hurt him, and the gods of
Walhalla amused themselves by throwing all sorts of
darts and clubs at him&mdash;none could hurt him. At last
the blind god Höder, who loved the beautiful Baldur
none the less because he himself was weakly and
sightless, also ventured to throw a dart at his invulnerable
friend. It sped home, pierced Baldur’s heart, and
killed him. The dart was made of mistletoe, a tree
that does not grow on earth, but lives as a parasite high
up on other trees, and had taken no oath to spare
Baldur. It had been put into the blind god’s hand in
a friendly helpful sort of way by a designing female,
who was really the evil spirit Loki in disguise. What
is the allegory? Does the mistletoe dart stand for
calumny? Is the mistletoe associated with calumny
because it is a parasite in high places? If one must
choose between the mistletoe myth of Norsemen and
Briton&mdash;the latter, which survives in the power
accorded to the mistletoe to license, even to command,
by its mere overhead existence, the giving and taking of
unexpected kisses and of expected ones, too, is certainly
the more cheerful and suitable to the hopeful enterprise
of New Year.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_24">24. <em>The Cattle Show</em></h2>
</div>


<p>I always look upon the Christmas Cattle Show of the
Smithfield Club as a scientific delight. Breeding is<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
a most serious branch of scientific knowledge, held by
many people (of whom I am one) to be of more
importance to statesmen, politicians, and philanthropists
than any other kind of knowledge, and yet almost
absolutely neglected and completely ignored except by
our farmers and horticulturists. When examining in
turn the splendid animals at Islington I have felt
indignant that it should be not improbable that, owing
to ignorance and neglect in official quarters, the long
matured traditions and built-up skill of our cattle-breeders
will be destroyed, crushed out of existence by
huge, devastating capitalist “combines.” Soon we shall
not get the beef we wish for, but we shall have to take
whatever inferior stuff the giant monopolist chooses to
force on us&mdash;or go without! Our wonderful stock, so
patiently and happily bred, the envy of the world, will
disappear, and our breeders forget their art. We
shall none of us in Britain know more about prime beef,
roasts, grills, and marrow-bones than do the people of
Europe or the eaters of terrapin and soft-shelled
crabs.</p>

<p>It is wonderful that man, by deliberate choice in
selecting the sires and dams, has been able to produce
such widely-different races as the short-horn, the Highland
and the Sussex breed, and not only to produce them,
but to keep them there generation after generation. In
Nature, no such deviations are allowed&mdash;her motto is
“One species, one shape,” which is only relaxed so as to
allow a few geographical varieties. It is man who
makes all these strange breeds, just as he has made such
a queer, irregular, varied lot of creatures from the
human stock. Withdraw once and for all man’s
guiding “intelligence,” or perversity, if you choose so
to call it, and all these cattle would in a few hundred
years revert to one form, nearly (but not quite) the
same as that they came from. So, too, the Sheep; so,
too, the Pigs. And man himself, if one could poison<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
him universally with a mind-destroying microbe, would
become a beautiful, healthy, silly creature, dying at first
by millions annually, and at last represented by a
hundred thousand unvarying specimens, inhabiting the
warm but healthy corners of the earth, aimlessly happy,
free from disease, neither increasing nor decreasing in
number. It is legitimate, and is a means of examining
the whole problem of man’s history, to inquire whether
we have reason or not to suppose that, were intelligent
man thus removed arbitrarily and completely from the
scene, a new “lord of the world” would arise, by
normal evolutionary process. A bird, an elephant, a
rat, might give rise to the new line of progressive
development, and, unchecked by man, once jealous and
repressive, but now down-fallen, this new stock might
acquire such brains and wits as we men now boast of,
and people the earth. You never can tell! But it is
not the business of science to expatiate on such possibilities.</p>

<p>The domesticated cattle of Europe are of very
ancient prehistoric origin. They are for convenience
called “Bos taurus,” and seem to be derived from the
huge Bos primigenius or Aurochs, the Urus of Cæsar,
which was wild in Central Europe in his time, and from
the Indian Bos indicus&mdash;which is represented by the
Indian and African native breeds of “humped” cattle.
It is, however, very difficult to trace most of man’s
domesticated animals or his cultivated plants to their
original wild forms and original habitation. At the
Cattle Show we only see British and Irish breeds, and
only those cattle bred as meat-makers&mdash;the Highland,
the Welsh, the Shorthorns, the polled Angus, the South
Devons, the Hereford, the Sussex, the Galloway, the
Dexter. But there are other British breeds famous for
their milk-producing quality, such as the Guernseys and
Jerseys, whilst in Hungary, Italy, and Spain they have
magnificent breeds of great size, and often with truly<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
splendid spirally-turned horns (e.g. the Spanish), which
are used for ploughing and carting, and are fattened,
killed, and eaten after doing ten years’ good work.
These fine creatures are not seen in England. They
come nearest to the extinct Aurochs, which was,
however, bigger than any of them. It, too, existed in
prehistoric times in England, and we find its bones in
the gravel of the Thames Valley. The last aurochs, or
wild bull of Europe, was killed in Poland near the end
of the seventeenth century. The wild Chillingham
cattle are Roman cattle run wild. Many of these
breeds and the bones of the aurochs to compare as to
size may be seen in the north hall of the Natural
History Museum, where I commenced a collection of
domesticated breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, &amp;c.,
eight years ago. Chillingham cattle are to be seen in
the Zoological Gardens.</p>

<p>An interesting fact in this connection is that the
splendid bull which is kept in half-wild herds in Spain
for the purpose of “bull-fights,” is of a totally different
race from that of the big, long-horned agricultural
cattle. It may be seen at Cromwell-road, a specimen
killed in the ring having been procured at my request
and presented to the museum through the kindness of
the British Consul at Seville. The Spanish fighting
bull is, curiously enough, more like our Channel Island
milk-producing cattle than any other. It probably
came to Spain from North Africa&mdash;but there seems to
be no record or history concerning it&mdash;and if there were
it would probably be a fantastic invention. It seems
that only the bulls of this special breed can be played
with and dazzled by the matador’s red cloak. A Scotch
bull was once brought by sea to Seville and introduced
to the arena. He paid no attention to cloaks, red or
otherwise, but always went straight for his man. It is
stated that he was soon left quite alone in the ring!
The native African cattle (of Indian origin) at Ujiji and<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
in Damaraland have the biggest horns of any true
Bos&mdash;as much as <span class="nowrap">13 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> ft. along the curve from point to
point. We have to distinguish from our own cattle,
for which there is no name except “Bos taurus,” for
neither ox, bull, cow, heifer, nor steer will do&mdash;the other
bovines&mdash;the buffaloes, the yak, and the bison&mdash;besides
those great beasts the gayal and the gaur of India and
the banting of Malay. All these may be seen and
studied either in the Museum or the Zoological Gardens.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_25">25. <em>The Experimental Method</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The observations lately made by a Chancellor of the
Exchequer about an attempt to put salt on a bird’s tail
remind me of my first attempt to deal experimentally
with a popular superstition. I was a very trustful little
boy, and I had been assured by various grown-up
friends that if you place salt on a bird’s tail the bird
becomes as it were transfixed and dazed, and that you
can then pick it up and carry it off. On several
occasions I carried a packet of salt into the London
park where my sister and I were daily taken by our
nurse. In vain I threw the salt at the sparrows. They
always flew away, and I came to the conclusion that I
had not succeeded in getting any salt or, at any rate,
not enough on to the tail of any one of them.</p>

<p>Then I devised a great experiment. There was a sort
of creek eight feet long and three feet broad at the west
end of the ornamental water in St. James’s Park. My
sister attracted several ducks with offerings of bread
into this creek, and I, standing near its entrance, with a
huge paper bag of salt, trembled with excitement at
the approaching success of my scheme. I poured
quantities&mdash;whole ounces of salt&mdash;on to the tails of the
doomed birds as they passed me on their way back from
the creek to the open water. Their tails were covered<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
with salt. But, to my surprise and horror, they did
not stop! They gaily swam forward, shaking their
feathers and uttering derisive “quacks.” I was profoundly
troubled and distressed. I had clearly proved
one thing, namely, that my nursemaid, uncle, and
several other trusted friends&mdash;but not, I am still glad
to remember, my father&mdash;were either deliberate deceivers
or themselves the victims of illusion. I was
confirmed in my youthful wish to try whether things
are as people say they are or not. Somewhat early
perhaps, I adopted the motto of the Royal Society,
“Nullius in verba.” And a very good motto it is, too,
in spite of the worthy Todhunter and other toiling
pedagogues, who have declared that it is outrageous to
encourage a youth to seek demonstration rather than
accept the statement of his teacher, especially if the
latter be a clergyman. My experiment was on closely
similar lines to that made by the Royal Society on
July 24, 1660&mdash;in regard to the alleged property of
powdered rhinoceros horn&mdash;which was reputed to
paralyse poisonous creatures such as snakes, scorpions,
and spiders. We read in the journal-book, still preserved
by the society, under this date: “A circle was
made with powder of unicorne’s horn, and a spider set
in the middle of it, but it immediately ran out several
times repeated. The spider once made some stay upon
the powder.”</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_26">26. <em>Hypnotism and an Experiment on the Influence of the Magnet</em></h2>
</div>


<p>A more interesting result followed from an experiment
made in the same spirit twenty-five years later.
I was in Paris, and went with a medical friend to visit
the celebrated physician Charcot, to whom at that time
I was a stranger, at the Salpêtrière Hospital. He and<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
his assistants were making very interesting experiments
on hypnotism. Charcot allowed great latitude to the
young doctors who worked with him. They initiated
and carried through very wild “exploratory” experiments
on this difficult subject. Charcot did not discourage
them, but did not accept their results unless
established by unassailable evidence, although his views
were absurdly misrepresented by the newspapers and
wondermongers of the day.</p>

<p>At this time there had been a revival of the ancient
and fanciful doctrine of “metallic sympathies,” which
flourished a hundred years ago, and was even then but
a revival of the strange fancies as to “sympathetic
powders,” which were brought before the Royal Society
by Sir Kenelm Digby at one of its first meetings, in
1660. In the journal-book of the Royal Society of
June 5 of that year, we read, “Magnetical cures were
then discoursed of. Sir Gilbert Talbot promised to
bring in what he knew of sympatheticall cures. Those
that had any powder of sympathy were desired to bring
some of it at the next meeting. Sir Kenelm Digby
related that the calcined powder of toades reverberated,
applyed in bagges upon the stomach of a pestiferate
body, cures it by several applications.” The belief in
sympathetic powders and metals was a last survival of
the mediæval doctrine of “signatures,” itself a form of
the fetish still practised by African witch-doctors, and
directly connected with the universal system of magic
and witchcraft of European as well as of more remote
populations. To this day, such beliefs lie close beneath
the thin crust of modern knowledge and civilisation,
even in England, treasured in obscure tradition and
ready to burst forth in grotesque revivals in all classes
of society. The Royal Society put many of these
reputed mechanisms of witchcraft and magic to the
test, and by showing their failure to produce the effects
attributed to them, helped greatly to cause witches,<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
wizards, and their followers to draw in their horns and
disappear. The germ, however, remained, and reappears
in various forms to-day.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago some of the doctors in Paris believed
that a small disc of gold, or copper, or of silver, laid
flat on the arm could produce an absence of sensation
in the arm, and that whilst one person could be thus
affected by one metal another person would respond
only to another metal, according to a supposed “sympathy”
or special affinity of the nervous system for
this or that metal. This astonishing doctrine was
thought to be proved by certain experiments made with
the curiously “nervous” (hysterical) women who frequent
the Salpêtrière Hospital as out-patients. That the loss
of sensation, which was real enough, was due to what is
called “suggestion”&mdash;that is to say, a belief on the
part of the patient that such would be the case, because
the doctor said it would&mdash;and had nothing to do with
one metal or another, was subsequently proved by
making use of wooden discs in place of metallic ones,
the patient being led to suppose that a disc of metal of
the kind with which she believed herself “sympathetic”
was being applied. Sensation disappeared just as
readily as when a special metallic disc was used.</p>

<p>The old hypothesis of the influence of a magnet on
the human body was at this time revived, and Charcot’s
pupils found that when a susceptible female patient
held in the hand a bar of iron surrounded by a coil of
copper wire leading to a chemical electric cell or battery
nothing happened so long as the connection was broken.
But as soon as the wire was connected so as to set up an
electric current and to make the bar of iron into a
magnet, the hand and arm (up to the shoulder) of the
young woman holding the bar, lost all sensation. She
was not allowed to see her hand and arm, and was
apparently quite unconscious of the thrusting of large
carpet-needles into, and even through, them, though as<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
long as the bar of iron was not magnetised she shrunk
from a pin-prick applied to the same part. I saw this
experiment with Charcot and some others present, and
I noticed that the order to an assistant to “make
contact,” that is to say, to convert the bar of iron into
a magnet, was given very emphatically by Charcot, and
that there was an attitude of expectation on the part of
all present&mdash;which was followed by the demonstration
by means of needle-pricking that the young woman’s
arm had lost sensation, or, as they say, “was in a state
of anæsthesia.”</p>

<p>Charcot went away saying he should repeat the experiment
before some medical friends in an hour or two.
In the meantime, being left alone in the laboratory
with my companion as witness, I emptied the chemical
fluid (potassium bichromate) from the electric battery
and substituted pure water. It was now incapable of
setting up an electric current and converting the bar
into a magnet. When Charcot returned with his
visitors, the patient was brought in, and the whole
ritual repeated. There was no effect on sensation when
the bar was held in the hand so long as the order to
set the current going, and so magnetise the bar, had
not been given. At last the word was given, “Make!”
and at once the patient’s arm became anæsthetised, as
earlier in the day. We ran large carpet-needles into
the hand without the smallest evidence of the patient’s
knowledge. The order was given to break the current
(that is, to cease magnetising the bar), and at once the
young woman exhibited signs of discomfort, and
remonstrated with Charcot for allowing such big needles
to be thrust into her hand when she was devoid of
sensation! My experiment had succeeded perfectly.</p>

<p>It would not have done to let Charcot, or anyone
else (except my witness) know that when the order
“Make” was given, there was no “making,” but that
the bar remained as before un-magnetised. The conviction<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
of everyone, including Charcot himself, that the
bar became a magnet, and that loss of sensation would
follow, was a necessary condition of the “suggestion”
or control of the patient. It was thus demonstrated
that the state of the iron bar as magnet or not magnet
had nothing to do with the result, but that the important
thing was that the patient should believe that
the bar became a magnet, and that she should be influenced
by her expectation, and that of all those
around her, that the bar, being now a magnet, sensation
would disappear from her arm. With appropriate
apologies I explained to Charcot that the electric
battery had been emptied by me, and that no current
had been produced. The assistants rushed to verify
the fact, and I was expecting that I should be frigidly
requested to take my leave, when my hand was grasped,
and my shoulder held by the great physician, who said,
“Mais que vous avez bien fait, mon cher Monsieur!”
I had many delightful hours with him in after years,
both at the Salpêtrière and in his beautiful old house
and garden in the Boulevard St. Germain.</p>

<p>There are few “subjects” in this country for the
student of hypnotism to equal the patients of the
Salpêtrière and other hospitals in France&mdash;and very
few amongst those who read, and even write, about
“occultism” and “super-normal phenomena” know the
leading facts which have been established in regard to
this important branch of psychology. The study of the
natural history of the mind, its modes of activity, and
its defects and diseases is of fundamental importance&mdash;but
its results are often either unknown or greatly misunderstood
by those who have most need of such knowledge,
namely those who, mistaking the attitude of an
ignorant child for that of “a candid inquirer,” try to
form a judgment as to the truth or untruth of stories of
ghosts, thought-transference, spirit-controls, crystal-gazing,
divining-rods, amulets, and the evil eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_27">27. <em>Luminous Owls and Other Luminous Animals and Plants</em></h2>
</div>


<p>A correspondent lately described in a letter to a London
newspaper what he believed to have been “a luminous
owl,” which was seen flying about at night in Norfolk.
He mentioned the well-known fact that the dense greasy
patch of feathers on the breast of the heron is said to
be luminous by many trustworthy observers. It is very
probable that it was some carnivorous or fish-eating
bird, which was thus seen in a luminous condition at
night. The occurrence is much more in accordance
with known facts than most people would suppose to
be the case. Light, even strong light, is produced by
many natural objects without the accompaniment of
heat. We usually expect not merely fire where there
is smoke, but heat&mdash;in fact, great heat, where there
is light or flame. Yet there are many instances to
the contrary, and the word “phosphorescence” is used
to indicate a production of light without heat in
reference to the fact that phosphorus is luminous,
even when covered with water, although no appreciable
heat accompanies the light such as we are
accustomed to observe in ordinary “combustion” or
burning.</p>

<p>There is more than one kind of phosphorescence.
We separate the phosphorescence which is due to the
oxidation of peculiar fatty matters in the bodies of
plants and of animals (such as glow-worms) from that
which is caused by the breaking or heating of crystals
(white arsenic and apatite), or by longer or shorter
exposure to the sun’s rays (luminous paint), or by
radio-activity, or by electrical discharges in vacuum
tubes.</p>

<p>The “luminous owl” of the above-mentioned correspondent
and the luminous breast of the heron probably<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
owe their strange appearance to the birds having smeared
themselves with phosphorescent carrion or dead fish, the
luminosity of which is due to bacteria. The simplest
case of phosphorescence in living things is that of the
almost ubiquitous phosphorescent bacteria, minute
microbes like those which cause putrefaction. They
can be obtained and cultivated from almost any sample
of sea water. A thin slice of meat placed in a shallow
dish of salt water, so as to be barely covered by the
liquid, will in cool, damp weather, almost certainly
become covered with the growth of this phosphorescent
germ and appear brilliantly luminous. The populations
of seaside towns have often been terrified by
all the meat in the butchers’ shops suddenly becoming
thus phosphorescent. The growth may be cultivated
in flasks of salt broth. I have prepared such flasks,
which, when shaken so as to introduce oxygen, give
out a heatless blaze of light of a greenish colour,
brilliant enough to light up a room. I once found a
bone in a dog’s kennel which was brilliantly phosphorescent
owing to this bacterium. I kept it for several
days and showed it to Huxley as well as to other
friends. A certain kind of phosphorescent bacteria are
parasitic in the blood of sandhoppers, causing a disease
which kills them. The diseased sandhoppers shine like
glow-worms. I have found them abundantly on the
sea shore near Boulogne and near Trouville, but not
yet on the English coast. The bacteria can be seen
with the microscope and inoculated from diseased
luminous sandhoppers into healthy ones by using a
needle to prick first the diseased and then the healthy
creature.</p>

<p>The animals of the sea are often provided with
secreting organs, producing a fatty body which can
be oxidised and made luminous at the pleasure of
the animal. Thus many marine worms and minute
sea-shrimps give out brilliant flashes of light. Jelly-fish<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
of many kinds, and the minute noctiluca, no bigger
than a pin’s head, and the three-horned animalcule
Ceratium tripos are the usual cause of the phosphorescence
of the sea on our own coast. Deep-sea fishes
are provided with large phosphorescent discs or plates
on the surface of the body, which are sometimes
furnished with lenses like a bull’s-eye lantern. Glow-worms
and fire-flies and some tropical beetles are
examples of insects which have fatty phosphorescent
organs which they can illuminate (oxidise) at pleasure,
under the control of the nervous system. Some of the
West Indian phosphorescent beetles are remarkable for
having “lights” of two different colours. In the
marshes around Mantua the fire-flies are so abundant
at the end of June that the air for miles is full of
them, and the sight so extraordinary and beautiful as
to be worth a long journey to see. I have seen fire-flies
as far north as Bonn on the Rhine. Once I
was nearly upset by a horse shying at a glow-worm
on a bank in Worcestershire. Some moulds and well-grown
toadstools are phosphorescent, and a phosphorescent
earthworm, a peculiar species, now well known,
was first of all discovered in the South of Ireland by
the late Professor Allman. In the autumn I have
often picked up the phosphorescent centipede, which
is remarkable for the fact that the phosphorescent
material is a kind of slime which exudes from the
body&mdash;the creature leaving thus a luminous trail
behind it as it crawls. The piddock, or pholas&mdash;a
boring sort of mussel&mdash;has brilliant phosphorescent
glands, and the boys at Naples love to munch these
shell-fish at night, and then to alarm the passer-by
by opening their mouths, and showing a brilliant green
light within. Cases are recorded, but not recently, of
persons suffering from tuberculosis becoming phosphorescent;
a possible, but certainly a rare, occurrence.
Animal and vegetable phosphorescence is varied in<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
colour. The light emitted is blue-green, green, yellow,
orange, and even red in different cases. It is always
due to the oxidation of a separate fatty chemical body,
which can in many instances be extracted, then dried,
and subsequently made luminous by moistening with
ether, in consequence of which oxidation by the oxygen
of the atmosphere is facilitated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_28">28. <em>Reminiscences of Lord Kelvin</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The late Lord Kelvin was one of the most fascinating
personalities in the learned world. He uttered with a
delightful simplicity the thoughts, however romantic
and fanciful, which bubbled up in his wonderful brain.
It was because he was so much of a poet that he
was so great a man of science. Atoms and molecules
and vortices, and the vibrations and gyrations of ether,
and “sorting demons” were all pictured in his mind’s
eye, and used as counters of thought to give shape and
the equivalent of tangible reality to his conceptions.
By such conceptions he was able to present to himself
and his listeners the complex mechanisms of crystals,
of liquids, of gases, of electrical and magnetic currents,
and the endless astounding proceedings of rays of light
unsuspected by the ordinary man.</p>

<p>I think the last occasion on which he spoke in public
was after Sir David Gill’s brilliant address to the British
Association at Leicester last August. Lord Kelvin was
sitting close to me on that occasion, and I noticed that
he never moved his gaze from the speaker. He followed
Sir David’s account of stars, whose distance is stated by
the number of years it takes for their light to travel to
this earth, like an enraptured schoolboy, and cheered
when the evidence for the existence of two great streams
of movement of the heavenly bodies, in opposite directions,
going no one knows whither, coming no one knows<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
whence, was sketched to us by the lecturer. In proposing
a vote of thanks to Sir David Gill, Lord Kelvin
burst into a sort of rhapsody, in which, with unaffected
enthusiasm, he declared that we had been taken on a
journey far more wonderful than that of Aladdin on
the enchanted carpet; we had been carried to the
remotest stars and well-nigh round the universe, and
brought back safely to Leicester on the wings of science,
and the most marvellous thing about it all was that
it is true!</p>

<p>A few weeks before this Lord Kelvin was at the
dinner in celebration of the jubilee of the foundation
of the Chemical Society. In the speech which he then
made he referred to the painful accident of a year or so
ago which we had all so much regretted, when he had
burnt his hand accidentally in some experiments with
phosphorus, and had had to carry his arm in a sling
for some weeks. “Lord Rayleigh, the president of the
Royal Society,” he said, “has just told us how, as a
boy, he gave proof of his devotion to chemical science
by burning his fingers with phosphorus&mdash;but I think
my devotion must be considered greater than his, for I
burnt my fingers very badly with phosphorus only last
year, when I was 83 years old. It was at the end
of April. My friends said I was old enough to know
better, and it should have happened, not at the end
of April, but on the first day, of that month.” Lord
Kelvin was associated in work in the sixties and seventies
with another splendid man, Tait, of Edinburgh, who,
besides being a great professor of “Natural Philosophy,”
and joint author of the celebrated treatise known as
<cite>Thomson and Tait</cite>, was a great athlete&mdash;a golfer of
the first class, a first-rate billiard player, and a wise
lover of good ale, which he drank and gave to his
friends to drink, whilst he discoursed as few, if any,
to my knowledge, can now do, of things philosophical,
mathematical, and humane.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_29">29. <em>The So-called Jargon of Science</em></h2>
</div>


<p>It is often discussed as to whether science fails to
obtain the attention of the public and to excite intelligent
interest, owing to the obscure language which
lecturers and writers use when attempting to expound
scientific views and discoveries to “the ordinary man,”
or whether the fault lies with the “ordinary man”
himself, who is too frivolous to bother about following
carefully the words addressed to him, and, moreover,
has never learnt even the A B C of science at school.
It is certainly the case, as Professor Turner, the Oxford
professor of astronomy, has pointed out, that a popular
lecturer could tell his auditors a good deal more in
an hour if they already had the elements of his subject
at their fingers’ ends than he can under the existing
state of neglect of school education in the natural
sciences. That, however, seems to be obvious enough,
and does not touch the real question.</p>

<p>I have had a long experience, both in lecturing myself
and in assisting in the training of others to lecture and
also to inform the uninstructed public by means of
museum-labels and popular notes. It seems to me that
there are a large number of men who, even though
capable of expressing themselves clearly under usual
circumstances, yet fail to do so when trying to expound
or to teach, in consequence of three distinct faults, any
one of which is enough to render their discourse or
writing hopelessly obscure to “the man in the street.”
These are, first, a kind of pride in using special terms
and modes of expression which infatuates the lecturer or
writer, and leads him, without reflection, to an attitude
of mind expressed by saying, “That is the correct statement
about this matter, short and true. If you don’t
understand it, there are others who can. You can leave
it alone; it is not worth my while to spend time and<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
trouble to explain further; it is for you to give yourselves
the trouble to find out what I mean.” The second
fault is a real incapacity (which occurs in many learned
men) to realise the state of mind of the uninstructed
man, woman or child who eagerly desires to be instructed:
this is want of imagination and want of sympathy.
There is no cure for those who fail as teachers for either
of these two reasons.</p>

<p>The third fault is much more widely at work, and the
most kindly sympathetic lecturers and writers&mdash;but more
especially lecturers&mdash;often suffer from it and could easily
amend their practice. It consists in the attempt to tell
the audience or reader too much&mdash;vastly too much&mdash;in
the limit of one hour, or within the space of a few lines
or pages. This failure is well-nigh universal. I have
heard a distinguished discoverer, an eloquent and able
man, try to tell a completely ignorant audience in one
hour the results of years of experiment and work by
many men on the electrical currents observed in nerves.
The audience did not know what is meant by an electrical
current, nor anything about nerves, nor a single one of
the technical terms necessarily used by the lecturer. The
task was an impossible one. In six lectures it might
have been accomplished, and great delight and increase
of understanding afforded to the listeners instead of
perplexity and a sense of their own incapacity and the
hopeless obscurity of science. That, I am convinced, is
the real trouble, viz., the attempt to tell too much in a
short time, the failure by the lecturer to arrange his
exposition in a series of well-considered, definite steps,
each exciting the desire to know more, and each given
sufficient time and experimental illustration or pictorial
demonstration to lodge its meaning and value safely and
soundly in the tender brain of the ignorant but willing
listener. I am convinced that there is in very many
lecturers a tendency to try to crowd and compress into
one lecture what should occupy ten&mdash;if the willing and<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
intelligent but ignorant listener is to feel happy and is
really to understand what is said and done for his
instruction. A special difficulty also arises from the
fact that the lecturer often feels himself called upon to
address and to say something to those among the
audience who already know a good deal about his subject,
as well as to make things clear to those who are absolute
novices.</p>

<p>Some people have made this discussion the opportunity
for attacking on the one hand the English
language, and on the other the use of special names
applied by men of science to special things and special
processes. We cannot at once change the English
language, even did we wish to do so. But the creation
of special names to distinguish things not distinguished
from one another in common speech is a necessity. It
cannot be avoided. It is mere impatience and temper to
call the names and terms which are necessary as
counters of thought “jargon.” No doubt there may
be in some lecturers and writers a tendency to excessive
use of special terms and names, but the real trouble in
the matter arises from the too rapid thrusting of a large
number of such unfamiliar words upon an untrained
audience. If new words are introduced in moderation
they can be assimilated. They cannot be dispensed
with altogether. A correspondent lately complained
to me that I wrote of the minute creature which causes
the sleeping sickness as a Trypanosome, whereas, had I
called it “a blood-parasite” he would have known what
I meant, and been able to follow my statement more
easily. I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with him.
There are many kinds of blood-parasites; there are the
worms known as Filariæ, there are the vegetable
microbes known as bacteria and bacilli and spirilla, and
there are minute creatures of an animal nature called
pyroplasma and trypanosoma (beside some others).
These must be distinguished from one another if we are<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
to understand anything about the causation of disease
by microbes. It would be mere muddling and confusion
to simply call them all by the same name, simply
“blood parasite.” That would cause the same sort of
confusion as would occur if the Smiths or Browns of our
acquaintance had no Christian names by which we can
separate each member of the class from the others and
assign to him his own special qualities, opinions, and
property. What some people call “scientific jargon”
is assuredly not a thing to be proud of or to mouth with
a sense of superiority. Nevertheless, it is absolutely
necessary, and must be introduced gently and considerately
to the stranger who can and will, if reasonably
handled, appreciate the immeasurable advantage of
having distinct words to signify distinct things. That,
after all, is an elementary feature in all language. And
just as the “jargon” of a game, a sport, or a profession
has a fascination for those who use it, and forms a bond
of union or special understanding between them, so
inevitably does the jargon of a branch of science
flourish in the thought and on the lips of those who
devote themselves to that branch, and bind them in
a sort of freemasonry. We do not expect cricketers
or golfers to talk in plain English; why should we
expect chemists or naturalists to do so? After all, it is
a question of moderation and of gradually increasing the
dose. The beginner must not be terrified by an array
of outlandish words.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_30">30. <em>Rats and the Plague</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Rats! Who said rats? That is an important
question, because the word means different things to
different people. To some persons “rats” means
simply “nonsense”! To Sir James Crichton Browne
it means the devastator of stores and the dread carrier<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
of bubonic plague. To the naturalist it means a group
or natural cohort of small mammals similar to our
common rat and mouse, representatives of which are
found in every quarter of the globe and in almost
every island of the sea. The distinct “kinds” or
“species” are numbered by the hundred. They are
extraordinarily alike, and can only be distinguished
and classified into proper “species” by careful examination
and measurement. Mr. Oldfield Thomas, of the
Natural History Museum, has made a special study
of them. To give an idea of his work, it may be
mentioned that ninety different names had been given
by previous writers to as many apparently distinct
kinds of rat occurring in India. But by careful
measurement and study of the relations to one another
of these rats, Mr. Thomas has reduced the number of
really distinct Indian species of rats and mice (for a
mouse is only a smaller rat) to nineteen. What we
call in English water-rats, or water-voles, field-voles,
and such little foreign beasts as the lemming and the
hamster, are very close to rats in appearance, but are
separated on account of clear differences of structure
from true rats and mice.</p>

<p>At a meeting in London the total destruction of
“rats” was advocated. Whether it was affirmed at the
meeting, or was merely an error of those who wrote and
commented on the matter afterwards, I do not know,
but it was very generally stated in this connection that
the old Black rat (known to naturalists as Mus rattus)
is quite extinct in England, and that its place has been
taken by the Norwegian, or Grey rat (Mus decumanus),
also called the Hanoverian rat, because it became
noticeable by its abundance in this country at the
time of the accession of the Hanoverian kings. The
Black rat is not extinct in England, not even very rare.
Mr. Stendall lately sent me specimens caught in his warehouse
in the City of London, where they are abundant.<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
In many localities, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</i> Great Yarmouth, and in isolated
dwelling-places they occur, and even outnumber the
Norwegian rat. A most important and remarkable
fact is that the rats which infest ships are often all Black
rats. The Black rat, or Alexandrine rat (as Mr. Thomas
calls it), lives in our houses, in the roof, in recesses of
woodwork. It is a house rat, whereas the Grey, or
Norwegian rat, lives in the sewers and the banks of
ditches, and only comes up into the basement of houses
through defective building. The Grey rat has driven
out the water-voles from many river banks near towns,
just as he has to a great extent taken the place of the
Black rat in houses where the kitchen and food stores
are close to and in communication with the sewer!</p>

<p>The Black rat cannot be really distinguished by his
blackness. That is why some naturalists call him the
Alexandrine rat, so as to avoid a misleading implication.
He is often of a bright yellowish-brown colour
along the back&mdash;with longer dark-brown hairs and a
good deal of grey elsewhere&mdash;quite like the Norwegian
or Grey rat in colour. At the same time he is often
blackish, and frequently very black. The colour of all
these kinds of rats and mice can vary, according to the
conditions and colour surroundings in which they live.
Black, white, sandy-brown, or a mixture of spots of all
three colours, or a uniform “mouse-brown” tint, are
(as most boys know) the possibilities revealed by
allowing them to breed in captivity. Nature selects
accordingly the particular tint which affords protection
from observation by enemies in a given locality.</p>

<p>The real distinction between the Black (Alexandrine)
rat and the Grey (Norwegian) rat is that the Black rat
is smaller, has a tail longer than its body (125 per cent.),
and long and wide ears, which stand out from the head.
The Grey (Norwegian) rat is a larger, heavy-bodied rat,
with a tail shorter than its body (90 per cent.), and
short ears. Both these rats are common in India, but<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
there is a third kind, which is the commonest of the
three in Calcutta, and is probably the one most concerned
in the dissemination of plague. It differs in
some definite features from both the Black rat and
the Grey rat, although it is very much like the latter
in general appearance. It is called Nesokia Bengalensis,
or Mole-rat. It is a big rat&mdash;its tail is only 70 per
cent. the length of its body; the pads on the soles
of its feet differ from those of the two other rats;
its fur is thin and bristly, and when it is put into a
cage it erects its bristles and spits! It is, like the
Black rat, a stable and granary rat, and makes burrows
in which it stores grain.</p>

<p>The rats of Calcutta have been carefully studied
lately by Dr. Hossack, in consequence of their connection
with the bubonic plague. In the older native
parts of Calcutta, the Mole rat is twice as common
as the Norwegian Grey rat, and the Black rat not so
abundant as the latter. In the central European
part of the town the Grey rat is commoner than the
Mole rat&mdash;because, apparently, the better-built houses
do not afford such facilities for burrowing. The Black
rat is here also by a good deal the most uncommon of the
three. All these rats suffer from the plague, die from
it, and the fleas which lived in their fur leave them
as they get cold, and make their way on to human
beings, whom they consequently infect with the plague
bacillus. This has now been quite conclusively proved
by the Indian doctors charged by Government with the
study of the causes of the plague. The plague bacillus&mdash;a
minute, rod-like organism, which grows in the
blood and lymph, once it has effected a lodgment,
and there produces deadly poison&mdash;was discovered some
fourteen years ago, but it is only recently that the
plague bacillus has been shown to live in the intestine
of the flea, which sucks it up with the blood or other
fluids of the rat on which it lives. The flea, which<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
readily goes to man, does not suffer from the plague
bacilli which it has gorged, but conveys them to man
either by its bite or by its excrement.</p>

<p>This being so, it becomes important to know all
about the fleas of rats. Quite unexpected facts have
been discovered in regard to them. In Europe a
very large flea is found on the grey and the black
rat. This kind has not, I believe, ever been found
on human beings or been known to bite them. But
in India, in the Philippines, and in the ports of the
Mediterranean, this northern rat-flea is rare, and its
place is taken by a smaller and more actively vagrant
flea, which Mr. Charles Rothschild (who is the great
authority on fleas) found upon several different kinds
of small animals in Egypt. He named it “Pulex
cheopis.” This is the flea (and not our big northern
rat-flea) which acts as the carrier of plague-germs from
rats to man in India. It appears from experiments
that the common flea of man (Pulex irritans) and the
cat-and-dog flea (Pulex felis), as well as the big northern
rat-flea (Ceratophyllus fasciatus), can harbour the
plague-bacillus if fed on plague-stricken animals, but
there are no observations to show (as there are about
the “Cheops flea”) that they pass habitually from man
to rats and rats to men.</p>

<p>It is happily so long (200 years) since we had a real
outbreak of plague in Europe that we are still in doubt
as to whether the Grey rat or the Black rat is the more
susceptible to the disease&mdash;and what flea, if any, acts,
or has acted, as the carrier from rat to man in this part
of the world. The suggestion has been made that the
Grey Norwegian rat takes plague less easily than the
Black rat, or than the Indian Mole-rat (Nesokia), and
that the multiplication of the Grey rat in England
and France and consequent decrease in Black rats, is,
therefore, an advantage, so far as plague is concerned.
Possibly with the Grey rat has come the big rat-flea,<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
which does not attack man as does the Cheops flea.
The disappearance of plague in Western Europe seems
to correspond in date with the arrival of the Grey rat.
But, on the other hand, an alteration in the character
of our houses and their greater “accommodation” for
the new rat rather than the old black species may
account both for the increase of the latter and for
the absence of dirt and vermin in the dwelling-rooms
and bed-chambers which formerly enabled the plague-bacillus
to flourish amongst us, and to reach the human
population&mdash;as it does now in India and China. All
this shows how necessary it is to have accurate true
knowledge of such despised creatures as rats and fleas,
if we are to live in great crowded cities closely packed
together. And it should also make us try to gain
further knowledge as to these creatures, so that we
may form a reasonable anticipation of the consequences
we are bringing down on our heads when we set about
exterminating this or that race of animals. We are
not yet sure that the Norwegian Grey rat is not a
blessing in disguise.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_31">31. <em>Ancient Temples and Astronomy</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Janssen, the French astronomer, who died about the
same time as Lord Kelvin, acquired celebrity by his
discovery of a method for seeing and studying the great
flames or prominences which surround the sun. The
glare of the great fiery ball is such that the eye is
blinded in ordinary circumstances to the light of
these prominences. They were only known from their
coming into view during the total eclipse of the sun’s
disc by the moon. Then they were seen as a great
fringe of pointed, tongue-like flames around the
darkened disc. But at other times no use of smoked
glass or telescope could bring them into view. Janssen<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
went to India in 1868 to study these prominences of
the sun during the total eclipse of that year. His
purpose was to examine with a spectroscope the light
given out by the prominences. The day after the
eclipse Janssen found that he could still examine the
prominences and make out their shape and the chemical
elements present in them by looking at them through
the spectroscope, although the sun’s disc was now
uncovered, and it was impossible to see the prominences
with the unaided eye or with the telescope.</p>

<p>A young English astronomer, hundreds of miles apart
from Janssen, on the same day, Aug. 18, 1868, made
the same discovery in the same way, independently.
The English astronomer was Norman Lockyer, and the
French Academy of Sciences caused a medal to be
struck in commemoration of this discovery. The medal
is before me as I write. It shows the heads of Janssen
and of Lockyer side by side, as they were forty years
ago.</p>

<p>Each has carried on his researches and discoveries
with unabated vigour since that happy conjunction.
Sir Norman Lockyer has for many years added to his
constant study of the sun, fixed stars, and nebulæ
by means of the spectroscope and photographic record
of spectra, an inquiry into the evidence afforded by
astronomical facts first as to the age of Greek and
Egyptian temples, and latterly as to that of the
mysterious avenues and circles of stones (such as
Stonehenge) scattered about the British Islands, of the
history and use of which we have only vague traditions
and no actual records. These stone circles and avenues
are very numerous in Great Britain. The chief are
Stonehenge, Avebury, and Stanton Drew in the middle
South of England; the Hurlers, Boscawen-Un,
Tregaseal, the Merry Maidens, and the Nine Maidens in
Cornwall; Merrivale Avenue and Fernworthy Avenue
in Devon; many circles in Aberdeenshire, in Cumberland,<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
Derbyshire, and Oxfordshire, as well as monuments of
the same kind in Wales. Sir Norman Lockyer has
obtained measurements of most of these and plans
showing the relations of the principal lines of their
ground plan to the points of the compass, and so to the
position occupied by the sun and by certain stars on
given days of the year at the rising or setting of those
heavenly bodies. It may well be asked what is Sir
Norman’s object in doing this?</p>

<p>The explanation is as follows: The builders of
Christian churches in Europe have, as a rule, set out
the ground plan of the church shaped like a Latin
cross, so that the arms of the cross run north and south&mdash;the
head points to the east, or Orient, and the base to
the west. In consequence of this custom the word
“orientation” has come into use, to signify the direction
purposely given to the main length of a temple or
church. Now it appears that many, if not all, ancient
temples (including the ancient stone circles and avenues
of Britain) were purposely so “oriented” by their
builders that a particular star, or the sun itself, should
at a fixed day and hour in the year be seen during its
movement across the heavens through an opening in
the building especially designed for this purpose, so as
to allow the light of the star to fall into the most sacred
part of the temple, the “Naon,” or Holy of Holies.
At the moment of its appearance special ceremonies
were performed by the priests and worshippers in the
temple. The temple was dedicated to and carefully
“oriented to” that particular star. Thus, in ancient
Greece, the Pleiades, Sirius (the dog star), Spica, and
other stars were thus used; in Egypt, Capella, Canopus,
and Alpha Centauri; in Britain, Arcturus, as well as
those used by the Greeks.</p>

<p>These temples were really astronomical observatories,
and were meant always to remain “oriented” to their
special star, which must, if the earth were steady in its<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
position, although spinning like a top, and also circling
round the sun, duly appear each year at the expected
day and minute in the special “window” or aperture
designed so as to allow the star&mdash;then, and then only&mdash;to
shine into the temple. But the astronomers have
discovered that the earth is not steady! It “wobbles”
very slowly and regularly as a top wobbles. The position
of the axis of rotation&mdash;corresponding in position to the
stem of a top&mdash;does not remain one and the same, but
is pulled aside by the attraction of the sun and moon,
and moves round as one may often see in the spinning
of a top. The earth takes about 26,000 years for its
poles to complete the cycle of its wobble. <a id="Ref_81"></a>Moreover, in
addition to this, there is the fact that the earth’s axis
(stem of the top) is not nearly upright, but inclined at
a considerable angle (23 deg.) to the horizontal or plane
of its orbit round the sun, and that this inclination very
slowly changes, in addition to the wobbling movement.
The amount and rate of these changes in the
inclination of the axis of the earth have been definitely
ascertained by astronomers.</p>

<p>I mention the nature of these movements because
they clearly enough must upset altogether the desired
result of the orientation of temples. The last-mentioned
slow increase of obliquity affects solar temples
chiefly, and the more rapid wobbling affects the star
temples&mdash;both to such a degree that temples oriented
two or three thousand years ago are now quite out of
line, and no longer “catch,” so to speak, their particular
star or the sun on the appointed day. They no longer
point truly, because the “pitch” of the earth has
altered since they were set.</p>

<p>The next point is that astronomers are able to
calculate with surprising accuracy from other observations
how much exactly at this moment the “pointing,”
or “alignment,” must be “out” as compared with a
thousand, fifteen hundred, two, three, four, or more<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
thousand years ago. Accordingly, if you know the
star to which an ancient temple was set or aligned, the
day of the solar year which was the festival or critical
moment of the appearance of the star in the sacred
aperture&mdash;and how much the temple is to-day out in
its pointing, that is to say, the exact amount of
swinging which would bring the temple back into its
original relation to the star&mdash;you have a means of
measuring the age of the temple; you have a measure
of the time which has elapsed since it acquired this
amount of departure from correct orientation.
Astronomy tells you how much it must get out of line
in every hundred years.</p>

<p>Mr. F. C. Penrose, F.R.S., investigated this matter in regard
to several Greek temples; others besides Sir Norman
Lockyer have written on the aberration and calculable
age of Egyptian temples. It has, for instance, actually
been found that the temple of Ptah was aligned to the
sun in the year 5200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The alignment is no longer
correct, and it appears that the Egyptians themselves
discovered that some of their most ancient temples had
lost correct alignment, and erected new and corrected
buildings in connection with them, and re-dedicated
them. Now Sir Norman is making a vigorous effort to
procure all the possible measurements and indications
concerning the prehistoric circles and avenues of
Britain before it is too late. They are being more and
more rapidly destroyed. Stonehenge has been carefully
measured and its present alignment determined by
various surveyors. Its age is discussed by Sir Norman
Lockyer in an interesting book, but we may soon
expect a further discussion of the whole subject of
these prehistoric British monuments from his pen. In
some cases, as in that of Stonehenge, the relation of
the temple to the sun is obvious and confirmed by
tradition and existing custom. But in many cases investigation
is rendered very difficult by the absence of<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
any immediate indication of what precisely is the
heavenly body to which the temple was at its foundation
oriented.</p>

<p>In the case of Stonehenge, the conclusion at which
Sir Norman Lockyer arrives is that there was an earlier
circle of small stones (still represented), but that the
temple was rededicated, and the larger trilithons (each
consisting of two uprights and a cross-piece) erected,
and the main opening of the circle aligned to the
midsummer rising sun about 1700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, with a possible
error of 200 years, more or less. This is arrived at by
measurements showing the exact amount by which the
alignment is “out” at the present day. This date is
confirmed by the recent discovery of numerous stone
hammers when one of the big stones was dug under and
restored to the upright position from which it had
slipped. The stone age is believed to have given place
in Britain to the use of metal before 1700 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and no
metal tools were found at Stonehenge.</p>

<p>Stonehenge&mdash;the most wonderful, mysterious, and
complete of the great astronomical temples of Western
Europe&mdash;has come down to us from the absolute
darkness of prehistoric ages. Its secrets are still
buried in the ground around and under its huge
monoliths. This prodigious relic of the past is actually
the private possession of one happy man, Sir Edmund
Antrobus. Only two years ago he earned the gratitude
of all men by employing workmen and machinery, at
considerable expense, to restore one of the great stones
to its upright position. The extraordinary thing is
that whatever money is needed for the purpose is not
at once offered to enable him to examine and replace
with scrupulous care every stone, big and small, every
scrap of soil, within an area of many hundred yards,
embracing Stonehenge and all around it. I understand
that he is willing to sell this great possession to the
nation. It surely ought to be acquired as national<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
property, and reverently excavated and preserved,
whilst every fragment of significance found in the
excavations should be placed in a special museum at
Amesbury or Salisbury, under unassailable guardianship.
Year by year it has crumbled away. We owe the
sincerest thanks to Sir Edmund Antrobus for having
placed a light wire fence around the venerated relics,
and for putting a guardian in charge so as to arrest,
even at this latest moment, the final desecration and
destruction of this splendid thing by heedless ruffians.
The protection afforded is, nevertheless, insufficient.
The delay in examining everything on the spot and in
making all that remains absolutely secure is a national
disgrace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_32">32. <em>Alchemists of To-day and Yesterday</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The claim to have devised a secret process in virtue
of which sugar or charcoal placed in an iron crucible
and heated to a tremendous temperature is found on
subsequent cooling to contain large marketable diamonds
has a close similarity to the pretensions of the alchemists.
It differs in the fact that very minute
diamonds have actually been formed by a scientific
chemist (M. Moissan) in such a way, whilst the alchemists’
search was for a substance&mdash;the “philosopher’s
stone,” as it was called, which was never discovered, but
was supposed to have the property, if mixed and heated
in a crucible with a base metal, of converting the latter
into gold. From time to time those engaged in this
search honestly thought that they had succeeded; others
were impostors, and others laboured year after year, led
on by elusive results and dazzling possibilities.</p>

<p>In England, after the true scientific spirit had been
brought to bear on such inquiries by Robert Boyle and<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
the founders of the Royal Society in the later years of
the seventeenth century, little was heard of “alchemy,”
and the word “chemistry” took its place, signifying a
new method of study in which the actual properties of
bodies, their combinations and decompositions, were
carefully ascertained and recorded without any prepossessions
as to either the mythical philosopher’s stone
or the elixir of life. But as late as 1783&mdash;only a
hundred and twenty-five years ago&mdash;we come across a
strange and tragic history in the records of the Royal
Society associated with the name of James Price, who
was a gentleman commoner of Magdalen Hall, Oxford.
After graduating as M.A., in 1777 he was, at the age
of twenty-nine, elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
London. In the following year the University of Oxford
conferred on him the degree of M.D. in recognition
of his discoveries in natural science, and especially
for his chemical labours. Price was born in London
in 1752, and his name was originally Higginbotham,
but he changed it on receiving a fortune from a
relative.</p>

<p>This fortunate young man, whose abilities and
character impressed and interested the learned men of
the day, provided himself with a laboratory at his
country house at Stoke, near Guildford. Here he
carried on his researches, and the year after that in
which honours were conferred on him by his university
and the great scientific society in London, he invited a
number of noblemen and gentlemen to his laboratory
to witness the performance of seven experiments,
similar to those of the alchemists&mdash;namely, the transmutation
of baser metals into silver and into gold.
The Lords Onslow, Palmerston, and King of that date
were amongst the company. Price produced a white
powder, which he declared to be capable of converting
fifty times its own weight of mercury into silver, and a
red powder, which, he said, was capable of converting<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
sixty times its own weight of mercury into gold. The
preparation of these powders was a secret, and it was
the discovery of them for which Price claimed attention.
The experiments were made. In seven successive trials
the powders were mixed in a crucible with mercury,
first four crucibles, with weighed quantities of the white
powder, and then three other crucibles with weighed
quantities of the red powder. Silver and gold appeared
in the crucibles after heating in a furnace, as predicted
by Price. The precious metal produced was examined
by assayers and pronounced genuine. Specimens of the
gold were exhibited to his Majesty King George III.,
and Price published a pamphlet entitled “An Account
of Some Experiments, &amp;c.,” in which he repudiated the
doctrine of the philosopher’s stone, but claimed that he
had, by laborious experiment, discovered how to prepare
these composite powders, which were the practical
realisation of that long-sought marvel. He did not,
however, reveal the secret of their preparation. The
greatest excitement was caused by this publication
appearing under the name of James Price, M.D. (Oxon.),
F.R.S. It was translated into foreign languages, and
caused a tremendous commotion in the scientific world.</p>

<p>Some of the older Fellows of the Royal Society,
friends of Price, now urged him privately to make known
his mode of preparing the powders, and pointed out the
propriety of his bringing his discovery before the society.
But this Price refused to do. To one of his friends he
wrote that he feared he might have been deceived by
the dealers who had sold mercury to him, and that
apparently it already contained gold. He was urged by
two leading Fellows of the society to repeat his experiments
in their presence, and he thereupon wrote that the
powders were exhausted, and that the expense of making
more was too great for him to bear, whilst the labour
involved had already affected his health, and he feared
to submit it to a further strain. The Royal Society<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
now interfered, and the president (Sir Joseph Banks)
and officers insisted that, “for the honour of the
society,” he must repeat the experiments before delegates
of the society, and show that his statements were truthful
and his experiments without fraud.</p>

<p>Under this pressure the unhappy Dr. Price consented
to repeat the experiments. He undertook to prepare in
six weeks ten powders similar to those which he had
used in his public demonstration. He appears to have
been in a desperate state of mind, knowing that he could
not expect to deceive the experts of the society. He hastily
studied the works of some of the German alchemists as
a forlorn hope, trusting that he might chance upon a
successful method in their writings. He also prepared a
bottle of laurel water, a deadly poison. Three Fellows
of the Royal Society came on the appointed day, in
August, 1783, to the laboratory, near Guildford. It
is related (I hope it is not true) that one of them visited
the laboratory the day before the trial, and, having obtained
entrance by bribing the housekeeper in Price’s absence,
discovered that his crucibles had false bottoms and
recesses in which gold or silver could be hidden before
the quicksilver and powder were introduced. Dr. Price
appears to have received his visitors, but whether he
commenced the test experiments in their presence or not
does not appear. When they were solemnly assembled
in the laboratory he quietly drank a tumblerful of the
laurel water (hydrocyanic acid), which he had prepared,
and fell dead before them. He left a fortune of
£12,000 in the Funds. It has been discussed whether
Dr. Price was a madman or an impostor. Probably
vanity led him on to the course of deception which
ended in this tragic way. He could not bring himself
to confess failure or deception, nor to abscond. He
ended his trouble by suicide. He was only thirty-one
years of age! Not inappropriately he has been called
the “Last of the Alchemists,” though a long interval of<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
time separates him from the last but one and the days
when the old traditions of the Arabians’ al-chemy
were really treasured and the mystic art still practised.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_33">33. <em>A Story of Sham Diamonds and Pearls</em></h2>
</div>


<p>It has been recently declared by a dealer in precious
stones that though diamonds and other stones can be
very well imitated, yet pearls cannot be. This is
hardly correct, as artificial pearls so well made as
to defy detection by the casual glance of any but
a professional expert are common enough. Who does
not know the pathetic story by the greatest of French
writers, Guy de Maupassant, of the wife of a poor
Government clerk, who borrowed a necklace from
another lady to wear at a reception at the “Ministry”?
She lost the necklace (I forget whether it was of pearls
or of diamonds, or both); but she and her husband
were too proud to confess the fact, and purchased
another necklace exactly like the lost one, for a sum
the outlay of which reduced them for the rest of their
lives to a state of penury and social exile. They
returned the new necklace in place of the lost one
without a word, and accepted their fate. By chance,
the poor ruined lady, fifteen years afterwards, met her
old friend, who had long since passed from her acquaintance,
together with other prosperous people.
Moved by her former friend’s kind reception, she
related the true history of the pearl necklace of long
ago. “Great heavens!” exclaimed the prosperous
lady. “The necklace I lent you was made with
imitation gems! It was not worth five pounds!”
Too late! Nothing now could give back to the
high-minded, self-respecting little couple the lost years
of youth passed in privation and bitterness.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_34">34. <em>The Nature of Pearls</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Pearls have been lately studied by zoologists, and
their true history made known. They are a disease,
caused, like so many other diseases, by an infecting
parasite. It is common knowledge that they are
found much as we see them in jewellery, as little
lustrous spheres embedded in the soft bodies of various
shellfish, such as mussels, oysters, and even some kinds
of whelks. They are not found in the shellfish like
crabs and lobsters, called Crustacea, but only in those
like snails, clams and oysters, called Mollusca. Pink
pearls are found in some kinds of pink-shelled whelks.
A pearl-mussel or pearl-oyster has a pearly lining to its
shell, which is always being laid down layer by layer by
the surface of the mussel’s or oyster’s body, where it
rests in contact with the shell, which consequently increases
in thickness. If a grain of sand or a little fish
gets in between the shell and the soft body of its
maker, it rapidly is coated over with a layer of pearl,
and so a pearly boss or lump is produced, projecting on
the inner face of the shell, and forming part of it.
These are called “blister-pearls,” and are very beautiful,
though of little value, since they are not complete all
round, but merely knobs of the general “mother-of-pearl”
surface. These blister-pearls can be produced
artificially by introducing a hard body between the
shell and the living oyster or mussel.</p>

<p>It used to be thought that the true spherical pearls
were caused by a hard granule of some kind pressing
its way into the soft substance of the shell-fish, pushing
a layer of the pearl-producing surface like a pocket in
front of it. But it is now known that this “pushing
in” is the work, not of an inanimate granule, but of a
minute parasitic worm, which becomes thus enclosed by
a pocket of the outer skin. The pocket closes up at its<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
neck, and lays down layer after layer of pearl substance
around the intrusive parasite, the dead remains of which
can be detected with the microscope in sections of the
pearl forming there a central kernel or nucleus. These
parasitic worms were first detected in the small pearls
formed by the common edible sea-mussel.</p>

<p>Though they are very small, sea-mussel pearls are
collected for the market at Conway, in North Wales,
and also on the coast of France. The parasitic worm
is the young of a worm which, when adult, lives in the
intestine of carnivorous fishes. It appears that it has
to pass from and with the mussel into shellfish-eating
sea fishes, where, although the mussel is digested, the
parasite is not, but grows in size and alters its shape
considerably. Then after a time the worm is swallowed,
with the fish in which it has fixed itself, by sharks, dogfish,
and such fish-eating fishes. In these at last it
becomes adult and of some size, an inch or so long,
varying according to the particular kind, and produces
many thousands of eggs, which hatch out as minute
creatures swimming in the sea-water, and fortunate if
they fall upon a bed of mussels. They enter the
mussel’s shell and make their way into its soft substance.
A certain number (very few) get encased in the skin
and covered up by pearl-layers, which is the mussel’s
way of killing them and putting them out of mischief.
The others which have entered other regions of the
mussel’s body thrive, and have a chance of being swallowed
by a mussel-eating fish, and then a further chance
of that fish being eaten by a shark. If this happens
the lucky worm&mdash;like the Italian who gets a winning
number in three successive drawings of a lottery&mdash;gains
the big prize. He becomes adult and produces
innumerable young, who in their turn enter upon the
chanceful career of a mussel parasite.</p>

<p>Thus we see that a pearl is not only a disease or
abnormal growth caused by a parasite, but is actually<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
an elaborately formed tomb or sarcophagus, in which
the parasite is enclosed layer upon layer. This mode of
disposing of parasites and other intrusive bodies is not
unusual in animals. The terrible little flesh-worm&mdash;the
Trichina&mdash;which causes the death of rats, pigs, and
men who eat raw meat, is sometimes conquered in this
way. It is found in the muscles (flesh) of man and
animals enclosed in little pearl-like sacs, half the size of
a hempseed, and it dies there, unless the invaded animal
should die, and its flesh be eaten (as raw ham for
instance) by another animal. The burying of inconvenient
corpses in plaster of paris, corresponding to
pearls as we now know them, has been a method of
concealment occasionally adopted by criminals. On the
whole, pearls have not very pleasant associations.</p>

<p>The history of the special parasitic worm which
invades the beautiful little pearl-oyster of Ceylon has
recently been followed out by skilful naturalists. There,
too, a smaller oyster-eating fish of a peculiar kind, and
a larger fish which eats the first fish, are necessary for
the reproduction and multiplication of the pearl-producing
parasites. The new Ceylon Pearl-Fishing Company
has, therefore, to see to it that both these kinds of
fish are encouraged to live in the sea near where the
pearl oysters are found, and it is their object to increase
the parasitic disease by which pearls are formed, and
ensure an abundance of parasites.</p>

<p>An interesting new method has been recently applied
to the examination of pearl oysters for pearls. The Rontgen
rays are used to produce a skiagraph (such as
surgeons use in searching for a bullet) of the pearl oysters
when brought into harbour. They are thus rapidly
examined one by one, without injury, and the shadow-picture
shows the pearl or pearls inside those oysters
which are infected. The pearlless oysters are returned
to the depths of the sea, whence they came&mdash;those with
small pearls only are kept in special reserves or sea-lakes,<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
in order that the pearl may grow in size, whilst only
those with good-sized pearls are opened at once, in
order that the pearl may be extracted and sent to
market.</p>

<p>There were great findings of pearls in the fresh-water
pearl mussels of the Scotch rivers in former days. In
the last forty years of the eighteenth century these
pearls were exported from Scotland to France to the
value of £100,000.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century not only did they get their
pearls from European rivers instead of from the East;
but, instead of being excited about the artificial production
of diamonds, they were driven wild with
astonishment by the demonstration of the volatilisation
of these stones&mdash;the disappearance of diamonds
into invisible vapour when sufficiently heated. That
the hardest stone in nature could be thus dissipated
into thin air seemed incredible. On Aug. 10, 1771,
a chemist named Rouelle invited to his laboratory
to witness this wonder a company comprising the
Margrave of Baden and the Princess his wife, the
Dukes of Chaulne and of Nivernois, the Marchionesses
of Nesle and of Pons, the Countess of Polignac, and
some members of the Academy of Sciences, including
the great chemist Lavoisier. Four diamonds&mdash;the
largest belonging to the Count Lauraguais&mdash;were
submitted before the eyes of all to the heat of a
furnace, and in three hours had completely evaporated.
There was, no doubt, room here for a mystification and
for the abstraction of the diamonds with a view to
dishonest appropriation. But no such purpose existed.
The experiment was a genuine one, and Rouelle and his
brother were honest investigators. They established
the fact, now demonstrated as a lecture experiment,
that the diamond is volatilised at very high temperatures.
A more celebrated “evaporation” of diamonds&mdash;that
which is known as “the affair of the Queen’s necklace”&mdash;took<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
place a few years later in Paris, when no scientific
investigation was connected with the embarrassing
disappearance of the Royal trinket.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_35">35. <em>A King Who was a Zoologist</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The King of Portugal, Carlos di Braganza, who was
assassinated in the spring of 1908, was one of the
most gifted and vigorous men of his age, fearless
and intelligent to a rare degree, good-hearted, and devoted
to the welfare of his people. If any man were
justified in having no fear of outrage because he was
conscious that his uprightness was proved and known
to all men, his benevolence experienced by all, his ability
and vast knowledge recognised by all, Dom Carlos was
that man. Fanaticism, however, takes no account of
the virtues of its victims. Until society has invented a
method for keeping instruments of destruction out of
the reach of dangerous, more or less maniacal individuals,
all those who excite the fanatic’s brain, even by the
excellence and nobility of their lives, risk death whenever
they trust themselves to the tender mercies of a
crowd. Psychology may one day enable us to detect,
and improved supervision of children enable us to
segregate before it is too late, the latent assassins in our
midst. If they have not a king as their quarry their
reason is palsied by a president, and were there no
presidents, they would become homicidal in the presence
of a prefect or a policeman&mdash;even of a professor.</p>

<p>Some four years ago I had the honour of conducting
Dom Carlos round the Natural History Museum in
Cromwell Road. He arrived without attendant or
escort, and I passed two hours alone with him. I had
been told that he was a great shot and fond of natural
history, that he played every athletic game, rode, and<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
swam better than the best, that he was a fine water-colour
painter, a real artist&mdash;and a first-rate musician
and singer. I was astonished at his knowledge and
personal experience in natural history. His burly form
and bright, honest face gave me a most agreeable
impression, and when he said (as I had been told he
would) to each explanation of a specimen upon which I
ventured for his edification, “I know! I know!” felt that
it was true, and that he really did know. “I have shot
thirty of them in the south of my country,” he said of
some rare bird. “I know! I know! I have described a
new species like that in my book on the birds of
Portugal. I shall send it to you!” was his comment on
another. When we came to some wonderful coral-like
specimens&mdash;sea-pens and sea-feathers, dredged in the
deep sea and preserved in spirits, for exhibition in the
Museum&mdash;he said, to my astonishment, “Those are
very bad. I get much better than those in my yacht
off the Portuguese coast. I preserve them myself; it is
a real art. I shall send you some.” I said they would
be a very welcome addition. “Yes, I know! I know!”
he said. “Would you like some fishes, too? The
Prince of Monaco has some fine things, and he led me
to collect also myself. I have now many things better
than his. I shall send you some fishes, too.” And he
did. A few months after his return to Portugal he sent
to the Museum a large collection, preserved in spirit,
which included many very fine and interesting specimens
of deep-water Atlantic fishes; also his work, with
coloured plates, on the Birds of Portugal, and a most
remarkable publication on the tunny fisheries of the
South Coast of Portugal&mdash;giving a careful survey of the
waters, sea bottom, currents, fauna, and flora in correct,
expert form, such as might issue from a Government
Fisheries Board, but in this case done, as modestly
indicated on the title-page, by the Head of the State
himself, “Dom Carlos di Braganza.” He went into the<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
work-rooms of the Museum, where some new fishes were
being drawn, and conversed with the naturalist in charge,
and criticised the drawings. He saw everything,
appreciated everything, and then looking at his watch,
said, “I have only five minutes to get to a lunch party.
Thank you very much for the most delightful time. I
should like to stay all the day; it is a splendid place,”
and was off in his brougham.</p>

<p>I exhibited the specimens and books sent by his
Majesty for some weeks in the Central Hall of the museum,
before they were incorporated in the great collection,
for I felt that it was a rare and interesting thing that a
king should not merely take a sportsman’s pleasure in
birds, beasts, and fishes, but actually be, so to speak,
“one of us”&mdash;a zoologist who discovers, describes, and
names new things. The Prince of Monaco is the only
other head of a State who is a serious scientific naturalist.
He has built and endowed a magnificent museum
and laboratory at Monaco, where his skilled assistants
carry on researches and look after the extremely valuable
and important collections which he has himself made in
a series of cruises in the Atlantic extending over many
years. He has not only employed capable naturalists to
help him, but is himself the chief authority and an
original discoverer in “oceanography,” the science of the
great oceans.</p>

<p>A year or so ago, when Dom Carlos visited Paris, a
special fête and reception was organised in his honour at
the “Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle,” in the Jardin des
Plantes. The “Museum” of the Jardin des Plantes is
a very remarkable institution, including a zoological
and botanical garden, laboratories of chemistry, physics,
and physiology, besides the great collections of minerals,
fossils, skeletons, and preserved specimens of animals and
plants. It is governed by the professors and the
director who are in charge of the garden, the laboratories,
and the collections, and owes its dignity and its celebrity<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
to the distinguished men of science who for a century
and a half have made discoveries and taught there.
They are not subject to a board of eminent and wealthy
persons, nor is the administration of the antiquities at
the Louvre and of the National Library muddled up
with that of the great scientific workshop of Natural
History.</p>

<p>When the President of the Republic conceived the
plan of entertaining the King of Portugal at the Museum
of Natural History there were those who supposed that
the Minister of Education would, as a great State
official, be called upon to arrange the proceedings.
Nothing of the sort was done. It was found that the
Minister had no authority in regard to the Museum,
which, as an independent State institution, organised
and carried out the reception through its own officers.
The director and professors received President Fallières
and the King, escorted by the troops of the Republic.
The garden and buildings were ablaze with light and
colour, and a large company assembled to take part in
the fête. In the great hall of the museum Becquerel,
Moissan, and others showed their most recent discoveries
as to radium, artificial diamonds, and such matters to
the King; others exhibited new birds and fishes, the
okapi and newly-discovered fossils, and briefly explained
their history and significance. The King conferred
decorations on the scientific staff, and gave friendly
acknowledgments to all who had thus sought to gratify
his special tastes, and prepared for him a really exceptional
gala-demonstration of scientific discovery. The
official “middle-men,” who in other countries contrive
to divert the honour and emoluments due to men of
science, to their own profit, were on this occasion
happily kept at a distance.</p>

</div>


<p>The cruel fate of Dom Carlos of Portugal naturally
enough produced philosophic and thoughtful articles in
some of the journals of the day. An able writer told
his readers that the “kingly caste” has characteristics
peculiar to itself, “which illustrate the Darwinian law.”
He does not say what Darwinian law, and I am afraid
he would find it difficult to do so. He says that people
who for centuries have had their own way (how many
kingly families have done so?), who have always lived
on good food and never tasted bad wine, and have
constantly conversed with interesting people (not usually
the chance of princes!) must certainly, if subject to
“the laws which govern animal and plant life,” produce
well-marked characteristics in their offspring&mdash;and he
goes on to speak of a fine appetite for food (what he
describes is really a morbid condition connected with
indigestion) as indigenous to Royalty, and declares
that the gift of recognising faces and remembering
names is “a faculty cultivated by generations of
practice.”</p>

<p>One must recognise with satisfaction the desire to
explain the facts and varieties of human life and
character by reference to “the laws which govern
animal and plant life.” It is by faithfully and truly
carrying out the inquiries suggested by that desire that
the knowledge which is the sole and absolutely essential
condition for the safe conduct of human life and the
increased happiness of human communities, can be
obtained, and by such inquiries only; and, further, only
upon the condition that the investigation is conducted
in the true scientific spirit with accuracy and without
prejudice. The remarks upon the kingly caste which I
have quoted above show with what “legerity and<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
temerity” a clever and respected writer will formulate
phrases and conclusions which are, in face of what
Darwin and his successors have demonstrated, absurdly
erroneous, in fact, topsy-turvy as compared with the
reality.</p>

<p>The main doctrine which Darwin and his followers
have established is that neither castes nor families of
higher or lower living things, including man, acquire
any new characteristics by exposure to special circumstances
or by consuming finer or coarser food,
which can or do become innate or fixed in the race.
The individual may be improved or depraved, enlarged
or enfeebled, by the conditions of his individual life,
but he cannot transmit the qualities&mdash;the improvement,
the depravity, the enlargement, or the dwindling&mdash;which
have been thus attained by him to his offspring.
The race cannot be changed in this way. All the
parents can transmit is the quality which they
themselves have inherited of resisting or of collapsing,
of becoming enfeebled, or of showing strength and
vigour, under certain given conditions. The characteristics
of Royalty are not characteristics brought about
by the Royal state, any more than the characteristics
of English race-horses are brought about by the racing
state or by life in a breeder’s stable. The characteristics
of Royalty are like those of other living things, the
characteristics of a certain family or blend of families
or strains. Whatever characteristics distinct Royal
families have in common with one another are not due
to the existence of a natural law in virtue of which
the occupations and opportunities of the Royal state
produce “faculties” or “characteristics” in the “blood”
or “stock.” Such similarity of characteristics is due
either to the similarity of the demands and conditions
of Court life in all parts of Europe, acting as an
educating force on the individual, or to the intermarrying
and consequent blending of family characteristics<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
among a large proportion of the Royal Houses at
present existing.</p>

<p>It is very difficult&mdash;indeed impossible until much
more is written and read on the subjects of breeding
and of psychology&mdash;to persuade people to abandon the
notion that a man who has drunk good wine and
conversed with interesting people will, as a direct
result, transmit something which he has “taken up” or
absorbed from the good wine and the clever people to
his offspring, and that a faculty for this or that art or
accomplishment cultivated by generation after generation
is increased thereby, and transferred as it were into the
very vitals of the race&mdash;the reproductive germs which
each individual has within him. There is no truth
whatever in these fancies. They are popular and very
natural delusions, which are not only devoid of direct
proof by simple observation and experiment, such as
that made by all breeders of stock and by medical men,
but are also contrary to the great general principles
which have been found to explain the varied and most
important facts known as to breeding, inheritance, and
variation. The same erroneous theory of inheritance
now applied to royalty has been put forward in regard
to the feeble-minded, the ill-grown, and the incapable
at the other end of the social scale.</p>

<p>The only way in which a quality, good or bad,
desirable or undesirable, is intensified, made inherent
and dominant in a race or strain or family, is by
selective breeding&mdash;selection due to natural rejection
of those individuals not possessing the quality, or to
artificial rejection of such individuals by the stock
owner and breeder. No human maker of breeds&mdash;whether
of cattle, horses, birds, or plants&mdash;ever yet
proceeded by exercising, feeding, educating, or otherwise
manipulating his sires and dams; he simply selects
those as parents which by natural variation have the
quality, more or less, which he desires, and he destroys<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
or sterilises those which fail to satisfy his requirements.
He is perfectly confident that in this way he can ensure
the reproduction and exaggeration or dominance of the
characteristics which he desires; he knows that he
cannot obtain a “strain” or “breed” by any treatment,
any feeding, or education of those which are born
without the natural, innate possession of the desired
quality, in a more or less marked degree. Once the
characteristic turns up as a congenital variation, it can
be intensified by coupling its possessor with a mate of
like quality; but both sire and dam have to be rigidly
selected with this purpose in view. Such methods are
not adopted in human families, even royal ones.</p>

<p>In considering these questions as to characteristic
qualities or want of qualities in groups and classes of
human communities, we see then that we have in the
first instance to distinguish very broadly between the
body or structure of the individual, and the “stirps”
or germ of the race which he carries within him. The
former may be vastly changed for the better or worse
as compared with average individuals, without affecting
in any way the latter. The germ is carried by the
individual member of the race in an almost complete
state of isolation or safety from the influences which
affect the individual’s structure generally (his body
as distinct from his germinal or reproductive substance)
injuriously or beneficially. The germ varies also, but
independently. That is a matter of primary importance.
Equally important in the case of man is a
peculiarity which affects his manifestation of qualities
in a way unknown in any other living thing.</p>

<p>Human society, in more marked and dominating
form, in proportion as it is what we call “civilised,”
has created for itself an inheritance which is not
dependent on the variations of strains and the laws
of actual breeding. Over and above&mdash;very much
above&mdash;what each man inherits in the form of qualities<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
and characteristics of his special family and stock&mdash;is
the enormous mass of accumulated experience, knowledge,
tradition, custom, and law&mdash;which pervades and
envelops, as it were, the mere physical generations
of this or that pullulating crowd of human individuals.
Tradition, at first conveyed by gesture and imitativeness
from parents to offspring, then by word of mouth, then
by writing, and finally by printed record, sanctioned
and enforced by all kinds of persuasion and compulsion&mdash;has
culminated in an educative discipline which
affects every individual in the community in the most
powerful way&mdash;and constitutes an inheritance of a
significance and activity altogether transcending, and
independent of that due to the physical transmission
of bodily and mental qualities. Public opinion, law,
knowledge, belief, custom, and habit exist, and pursue
their own course of change, as it were, outside the
successive bodily generations of a population. Yet
they determine in very large measure the characteristics
which each class, and the community as a whole,
exhibit. We have to distinguish those results which
are due to physical heredity, similar in man and in
animals&mdash;from results due to this all-powerful education
peculiar to man&mdash;education, which for civilised man
proceeds from almost innumerable sources&mdash;from
parents, nurses, playfellows, companions, social, professional,
and political organisations, as well as from
the professed teacher, and from the local peculiarities
of the simplest conditions of life. Hence it is that
man inherits very little in the way of ready-made
instincts, tricks of his nervous mechanism&mdash;but, on the
contrary, has an enormously long period of individual
growth and education, and inherits “educability”
to a degree which varies in every family and race.</p>

<p>To estimate correctly, and so to deal with these
various factors in human life, we require to know in
detail the laws of breeding, heredity, variation, and<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
selection in animals, and, further, the laws or formulated
results of enquiry as to the “educability” of the
human being, the range and the limits of “education,”
the relation of hereditary quality to education, the
causes of mental aberration and defect, of mental
qualities of all kinds, the value and the dangers of all
kinds of educational influences, whether physical, social,
or intellectual. These are matters in regard to which
there must be in the future more and more of common
knowledge and agreement; at present they are lightly
touched by politicians and journalists in a way which is
inconsistent with a knowledge of the facts or of their
importance.</p>

<p>When publicists airily declare that the virtues of
kings and the vices of paupers are both due to the
hereditary transmission of characters acquired by the
peculiarities of diet and exercise of the progenitors
of these classes it is time to protest. To cite the name
of Darwin and “the laws which govern animal and
plant life,” in support instead of in condemnation of
such baseless fancies, is, one must suppose, an evidence,
not of a desire to mislead, but of a regrettable indifference
to the conclusions of that branch of human knowledge
which is of more importance than any other to
the statesman and the philanthropist.</p>

<p>“Selection,” whether due to survival in the struggle
for existence or exercised by man as a “breeder” or
“fancier,” is the only way in which new characteristics,
good or bad, can be implanted in a race or stock, and
become part of the hereditary quality of that race or
stock. This applies equally to man and to animals and
plants. And this selection is no temporary or casual
thing. It means “the selection for breeding” of those
individuals which spontaneously by the innate
variability which all living things show (so that no two
individuals are exactly alike) have exhibited from birth
onwards, more or less clearly, indications of the characteristic<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
which is to be selected. Nothing done to them
after birth, and not done to others of their family or
race, causes the desired characteristic; it appears unexpectedly,
almost unaccountably as an in-born quality.
It may be a slight difference only, not easy to take note
of; but if it enables those who possess it to get the
better of their competitors in the struggle for life, they
will survive and mate and so transmit their characteristic
to the next generation, whilst those who do not possess
it and are beaten in life and fail to obtain food, safety,
and mates, will perish and disappear, and their defective
strain will perish with them.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_37">37. <em>Variation and Selection Among Living Things</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Selection is not a thing once done and then dropped&mdash;natural
selection is continuous and never-ending,
except in rare and special circumstances, such as man
may bring about by his interference, and then it does
not really cease but only changes its demand. The
characteristics of a race or species are maintained by
natural selection, just as much as they are produced
by it. Cessation of a previously active selection (which
is sometimes brought about by exceptional conditions)
results in a departure of the individuals of the race,
no longer subject to that selection, from the standard
of form and characteristics previously maintained. To
understand this, we must consider for a moment the
great property of living things, which is called
“variation.”</p>

<p>No two animals, or plants even, when born of the
same parents, are ever exactly alike. Not only that,
but if we look at a great number of individuals of a
race or stock, we find that some are very different from
the others, in colour, in proportion of parts, in character,<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
and other qualities. As a rule it is difficult to look
at such a number, because in Nature only two on the
average out of many hundreds, sometimes thousands,
born from a single pair of parents, grow up to take their
parents’ place, and these two are those “selected” by
natural survival on account of their close resemblance to
the parents. But if we experimentally rear all the offspring
of a plant or animal to full growth&mdash;not allowing
them to perish by competition for food, or place, or by
inability to escape enemies&mdash;then we see more clearly
how great is the in-born variation, how many and wide
are the departures from the favoured standard form
which are naturally born and owe their peculiarities to
this birth-quality&mdash;called innate or congenital variation&mdash;and
not to anything which happens to them afterwards
differing from what happens to their brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>Of course, we are all familiar with this “congenital
or innate variation,” as shown by brothers and sisters
in human families. How and why do innate variations
arise? They arise from chemical and mechanical action
upon the “germs” or reproductive cells contained in
the body of the parents, and also sometimes from the
mating in reproduction of two strains or races which
are already different from one another. When an
animal or plant is given unaccustomed food or brought
up in new surroundings (as, for instance, in captivity)
its germs are affected, and they produce variations in
the next generation more abundantly. The best
analogy for what occurs is that of a “shaking up” or
disturbance of the particles of the germ or reproductive
material, somewhat as the beads and bits of glass
in a kaleidoscope are shaken and change from one
well-balanced arrangement to another. And the same
analogy applies to the crossing or fertilising of “strain”
or “race” by another differing from it. A disturbance
is the consequence, and a departure in the form and<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
character of the young from anything arrived at before
often takes place. These variations have no necessary
fitness or correspondence to the changed conditions which
have produced them. They are, so to speak, departures
in all and every direction&mdash;not very great, but still great
enough to be selected by survival if occurring in wild
extra-human nature, and obvious enough when produced
in cultivated animals and plants to be seen and
selected by man, the stock-breeder or fancier.</p>

<p>Indeed the stock-breeder and horticulturist go to
work in this way deliberately. Though when they
have fattened an animal or fed up a plant they cannot
make it transmit its fatness or increased size to its offspring,
yet they can, by special feeding and change of
conditions of life&mdash;or by cross-breeding&mdash;break up the
fixed tendency or quality of the germs within the
parents so treated. Thus they get offspring produced
which show strange and unexpected variations of many
kinds&mdash;new feathers, new colours, new shapes of leaf,
increased size of root, length of limb&mdash;all kinds of
variations. From the congenital varieties thus produced
by “stirring up,” “breaking down,” or disturbing the
germ-matter (germ-plasm) of the parents, the breeder
next proceeds to select and mate those which show
the character which suits his fancy, whilst he destroys
or rejects the others. Thus he establishes, and by
repeated selection in every generation maintains, and
if he desires increases, the characteristics which he
values.</p>

<p>Birth-variation is then an inherent property of living
things (including man) as much as heredity, which is
the name for the property expressed in the resemblance
of offspring to parent. And birth-variation, or congenital
variation&mdash;that is to say, the being born with a
power to grow into something different (not greatly,
but still obviously, different) from their parents or
ancestry, and from their brethren and cousins, though<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
not subjected after birth to any treatment or conditions
differing from those common to all of them&mdash;is a quality
of living things which must be distinguished altogether
from the power of the individual itself, though not born
with qualities differing from those of its brothers and
sisters, to vary or change in some respects as compared
with other individuals when it is specially fed or exposed
to special treatment. The first is change, or
variation, of the “stirps,” or germ plasm; the second is
change, or variation, of the transient body of the individual.
The first is indefinite and may be of almost any kind
or form; once it has appeared, it is a permanent possession
of the race descended from its owner. The second is
definite and a direct reaction to the environment. Such
an individually induced or stimulated change is often
called an “acquired character.” It does not affect the
stirps, the inner reproductive germs, and cannot be
handed on by inheritance to a new generation.</p>

<p>What happens, then, when there is a cessation of
selection? All sorts of birth-variations appear and
grow up. The fine adjustment of form&mdash;maintained by
natural selection carried on unceasingly&mdash;no longer
obtains. The characteristics of the race become less
emphasised. All sorts of birth-variations have an equal
chance, and the tendency must be for those characteristics
which have most recently been established and
maintained by severe selection to dwindle and then to
disappear altogether. The majority of birth-variations
will&mdash;when selection is prevented&mdash;always tend to
present a lessened, rather than an increased, development
of any one characteristic&mdash;the excelling minority
will no longer be selected, but all will have an equal
chance in mating and reproducing. Hence, bit by
bit, all salient features, all the characteristics of the
race previously maintained by selection, will, as a
result of survival of all variations and general crossing
and interbreeding&mdash;dwindle and disappear. It is<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
to this process that the term “degeneration” has
been applied by biologists. How far it may go, and
what are its limits and various outcomes, I cannot now
discuss. It is sometimes spoken of as “retrogression”&mdash;which
implies wrongly a return to a previous state.
From some points of view it might be called “simplification.”</p>

<p>The point to which I have been making is this&mdash;that
civilised mankind appears to be very nearly in regard
to most points of structure and quality in a condition
of “cessation of selection.” It is the better-provided
and well-fed, well-clothed, protected classes of the community,
in which this cessation of selection is most
complete. Racial degeneration is, therefore, to be looked
for in those classes quite as much as in the half-starved,
ill-clad, struggling poor, if, indeed, it should not be
expected to be more strongly marked in them. There
are facts which tend to show that such anticipations are
well-founded.</p>

<p>This is a matter requiring further discussion. It is
probable, I may say in anticipation, that whilst natural
selection in the struggle for existence is only obscurely
operative (except as to alcoholism and some diseases) in
civilised man, yet what Mr. Darwin called sexual selection&mdash;the
influence of preference in mating&mdash;has an
important scope, and it may be that hereafter it will
be of enormous importance in maintaining the quality
of the race.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it seems that the unregulated increase of
the population, the indiscriminate, unquestioning protection
of infant life and of adult life also&mdash;without
selection or limitation&mdash;must lead to results which can
only be described as general degeneration. How far
such a conclusion is justified, and what are possible
modifying or counteracting influences at work which
may affect the future of mankind, are questions of
surpassing interest. In any case, it is interesting to<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
note that the cessation of selection is more complete,
and the consequent degeneration of the race would,
therefore, seem to be more probable in the higher propertied
classes than in the bare-footed toilers, whose
ranks are thinned by starvation and early death. One
may well ask, “Is this really so?”</p>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_38">38. <em>The Movement, Growth, and Dwindling of Glaciers</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Last summer we were watching the gradual change
of the brilliant sunlight on the snows of Mont Blanc
as the shadows crept up the pine-covered sides of the
valley of Chamonix. We noted how the highest peak&mdash;the
true summit of Mont Blanc&mdash;remained almost
white and brilliant when the somewhat lower and
nearer Dome de Gouter (so often, when clouds are
about, mistaken for the true summit by tourists) had
assumed a marvellous shade of saffron-rose colour. The
crevasses of the glaciers were marked by an unearthly
pale-green tint and delicate purple hues of weird beauty
were spreading over the evanescent forms of the great
snow-field, when one of the hotel guests&mdash;a citizen
of Geneva&mdash;said, “Ah, yes! Look at them whilst
you may, and wonder at them, those glaciers of the
Alps. They are but the remnants, the roots, as it
were, of the vast glacier which once filled the whole
of this vale of Chamonix and spread down into the
valley of the Rhone, and ploughed out with the slow
movement of its huge mass the deep rock basin of
the Lake Leman. Every year they dwindle, as they
have dwindled for ages past, and soon&mdash;perhaps not
more than another 100 years hence&mdash;they will have
disappeared utterly from human sight and knowledge.”
I continued to gaze at the scene, and as the night<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
fell and the distant details were lost to view I felt
as though a venerable, but decrepit, friend had passed
from my sight, never to return. I was rejoiced to
see the glaciers still there when the morning sun
showed forth their strange opaque white and faintly
green masses on the mountain sides&mdash;stupendous
outpourings, as it were, of whipped cream tinted
with pistachio-nut.</p>

<p>But was it true, that lament of the Genevese savant?
Undoubtedly the glaciers in many parts of the Alps
have been shrinking for the last thirty years. It is
longer than that since I first saw the glaciers of the
Chamonix valley, and there is no doubt that they have
shrunk up since then, leaving acres of boulders and
bare polished rock where was the ice I formerly climbed.
The glacier of Argentière, near the upper end of the
valley, is a mile or more shorter than it was; the
ice caves which we used to visit at the foot of the
Mer de Glace have melted away, and the end of the
glacier is now high up above a precipitous surface of
polished rock far from the site of the little pavilion,
with its gay flag and amiable guardian, who used to
exhibit the marvellous ice cavern.</p>

<p>I find on looking into the matter that it is true that
there has, during the latter half of the past century,
been a great dwindling of the lower end or “snout,”
a drawing back, as it were, not only of Swiss glaciers,
but of glaciers in other parts of the world&mdash;as, for
instance, in Alaska and in the Himalayas. But I
cannot avoid a feeling of satisfaction in recording the
opinion of geological authorities that, contrary to the
assertion of the Swiss pessimist, there is not any ground
for believing that the present noticeable shrinking is
due to a continuous process by which the enormous
glaciers of remote ages have been incessantly reduced
until now they are but rootlets or stumps of the former<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
masses, destined to evaporate completely under the
continued remorseless operation of increasing temperature.
On the contrary, it appears that, though there
are not accurate records and measurements as to past
centuries as there will be as to present and future
years, yet there is abundant evidence that Alpine
glaciers have grown longer in some centuries and retreated
in others. The period of alternate extension
and retraction has not been ascertained with accuracy,
but by some geologists it is supposed to be about fifty
years. The retraction or shrinking is not due to a
continuous increase of the temperature of the earth’s
atmosphere&mdash;or of this hemisphere&mdash;but to contending
causes which operate alternately towards increase and
towards decrease when one or two hundred years are
considered. Such are the greater or less rainfall and
snowfall over a very large area, and the formation and
persistence of clouds, concerned with which are probably
those varying quantities&mdash;the spots on the sun.</p>

<p>The simple proof that glaciers have extended and
again retreated within historic times is furnished by the
fact that in some parts of the Alpine range the retreat
of a glacier has uncovered ancient miners’ excavations,
which must have been worked when the glacier did not
reach the spot excavated. Subsequently the glacier
advanced, and now after some hundreds of years it has
again retreated and exposed the ice-covered borings and
workings. The tradition of a glacier-enclosed village
in the Zermatt mountains, shut off from the world by
the advance of glaciers, lost and mysterious, is evidence
that such advance has been observed by the native
population.</p>

<p>The natives who live near glaciers know that they
advance and retreat, but the fact that the whole glacier
is really a slowly flowing viscous mass&mdash;a sort of frozen
but not immobile river&mdash;was only established by scientific
observation in the last century. The frozen river is fed<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
by the snow which falls on the higher mountain ridges,
and is squeezed into the form of ice instead of snow
powder by its own weight as it slips down the inclines,
warmed by the unclouded sunshine. The big glaciers
move much more rapidly (or perhaps one should say
less slowly) in the middle than at the sides. The
measurements which have been made differ in different
glaciers and in different parts of the same glacier, and
show smaller movement in winter than in summer.
The advance of the sides is retarded, as in the case
of an ordinary river of flowing water, by friction against
the rocks, which enclose the glacier as its banks enclose
a river. A good average case shows a flow downwards
in summer of half a foot a day at the sides and a foot
and a half in the middle. The distance below the
snow-line to which the flowing glacier descends down
a mountain gorge&mdash;before it melts away and becomes
a river of liquid water&mdash;depends, as does the rate at
which it moves, in the first place, on the temperature of
the region and on the sharpness of the slope. A glacier
will flow downwards (as will a lump of pitch) along
a scarcely perceptible incline, but more slowly than
down a steeper incline, and it will, consequently, get
further down into the warm valley without altogether
melting away when the slope is steep.</p>

<p>But apart from these considerations, the bigger and
thicker (or deeper) the glacier, that is to say, the more
snow which each year falls at its starting-place and goes
to making it, the further down will it flow before melting
away; and it is the heavy snowfall of many years ago
or of a series of years long past which has to-day reached
in the form of ice the lower end of the glacier. So,
though the lower end of the glacier may melt more
quickly if the valley has become hotter, yet the heavy
snowfalls of fifty years ago may only now have reached
the valley, and may quite counterbalance the melting
action of the warmer summers. Or reverse conditions,<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
namely, less snow and lower or unchanged temperature
in the valley, may prevail.</p>

<p>The Government of India has lately established a
definite survey and record of the movement of several
Himalayan glaciers and of the variation in the distance
to which their “snouts” descend into the valleys.
Twelve glaciers were examined last year, and will be
properly watched in future. The Yengutsa glacier has
gained about two miles in length since Sir Martin
Conway visited it in 1892; the great Hispar glacier
has slightly retreated. The Hassanabad glacier three
years ago increased its length by a rapid progress of
the free “snout” of as much as six miles in three
months, and is now no longer increasing or advancing!
Many years ago it had reached its present position,
and then retreated. The rock masses carried on the
ice and left in great heaps at the point where the
glacier melted away are known as terminal “moraines,”
and often serve to show the position to which the snout
of a glacier once extended&mdash;far below its present limit.
A curious fact as to the increase and shrinkage of
glaciers is that of two neighbouring glaciers, as in
the case of the glacier Blanc and the glacier Noir in
Dauphiné (France), one may be advancing whilst the
other is in retreat. Further study and knowledge of
the causes of these variations will throw important light
on questions of general meteorology.</p>

<p>Although there is no evidence to lead us to suppose
that existing glaciers are now actually in a condition of
general retreat, leading to their ultimate disappearance,
yet it is one of the most certain and interesting results
of geological study that some hundred and fifty thousand
years ago the northern hemisphere was far colder than it
is now, owing partly to the same change in the inclination
of the earth’s axis to which I alluded on a former page
(<a href="#Ref_81">p. 81</a>) as affecting the orientation of ancient astronomical
temples&mdash;a change which diminished, when at its<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
extreme, the effective amount of heat received from the
sun in these regions of the earth. The peculiar scratching,
polishing, and erosion of rocks, the existence of
moraines, and other evidence, prove that enormous
glaciers covered the north of Europe, that England and
Scotland were in large part covered by a great ice-sheet
or glacier, and that the great valleys of Switzerland such
as the Rhone Valley and the basin of the Lake of
Geneva, were filled by enormous glaciers, which helped
to mould and deepen the valleys. The present glaciers
are truly the remnants or rootlets of those enormous
masses of the glacial epoch. On such of the land
surface as was not then covered by ice, existed the hairy
elephant or Siberian mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros,
wild cattle, lions, bears, hyenas, and other animals now
extinct in this part of the world. Man had made his
appearance, hunted these animals, and lived in caves.
His weapons and carvings and their bones tell us the
story in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p>The biggest Swiss glaciers of to-day, compared to the
great glacier of the Rhone Valley, of which they are but
the highest tributaries, still surviving unmelted among
the mountain-tops, are in size as a mountain freshet is
to the great stream of Loch Lomond, or as the Serpentine
in Hyde Park to the neighbouring Thames. Vast
as was the great glacier of the Rhone Valley, and
immense as has been the work done by water and ice in
carving the great highway in the mountain-mass of
Switzerland, it has all been effected since the date of the
formation on the sea-bottom and the subsequent elevation
of the strata which we call “the chalk”&mdash;a deposit
which comes not very far down in the series of strata of
the earth’s crust. Only 3,000ft. of deposit exist above
it, whilst below it are more than 60,000ft. of water-deposited
or “sedimentary” rocks. The huge Alps
have risen since the date of the “chalk,” for we find
strata containing marine shells of the Tertiary period at<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
a height of 10,000ft. in those mountains. Where those
shells now are was the bottom of the sea at a comparatively
recent date, probably not more than fifty million
years ago! And not only have the Alps been raised
since then from the sea level to 15,000ft. (the height of
Mont Blanc), but the huge mountain valleys and the
great chasm of the Rhone Valley many miles wide, with
its floor thousands of feet below the mountain ridges,
have been scoured out. Deeper and wider it has gradually
become as it has taken shape, whilst the mountain sides
have been removed first by water and later by ice&mdash;by
the great glacier consisting of solid ice, miles wide and
a thousand and more feet in thickness. The water no
longer fills the valley in solid form, but once again
rushes along as an irresistible torrent, tearing and wearing
the rock without rest or mercy, carrying it off by thousands
of tons day by day, year by year, to the plains
of Provence and the deep floor of the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p>The blue colour of the glacier ice&mdash;like that of pure
water&mdash;is now known to be due to no impurity or admixture
of other substances. It does not, as was supposed
by Tyndall, owe its blueness to a dust of finest
colourless particles as do blue smoke, the blue sky, and
as do the blue eyes which have attracted the observation
of naturalists (and others) in Ireland and the North of
Europe. Water, whether liquid or solid, is blue, just
as “blue copperas” is, or as “Prussian blue” is; but
light must pass through some ten or twenty feet thickness
of it to make the colour evident to our eyes. The
green tint is due to an admixture of yellow, the exact
cause of which is not quite easy to discover. Probably
it is due to minute quantities of earthy matter mixed
with the surface snow.</p>

<p>The pressing of the high-lying snow, so as to form
solid ice or “glacier,” is concerned with the same property
of snow as that which enables us to make snow<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
“bind” into a snowball. You cannot make snowballs
during very hard frost&mdash;the snow must be in air of
a thawing temperature at the moment it is squeezed by
the hand. The hand itself will not be warm enough to
produce that temperature when the thermometer is
below freezing-point. The snow commences to melt in
the hand when one squeezes it, and then when the
squeezing is stopped the water formed quickly freezes
again and cements the snow particles together to
form ice, enclosing innumerable minute bubbles. The
heat of the sun and the pressure of the weight of
the snow itself take the place in the mountains of the
warmth and pressure of the human hand. The minute
air bubbles make the newest glacier-ice white and
opaque, especially when seen in a great mass; but
gradually they get squeezed together, and the glacier
ice becomes first “fibrous” in appearance, and then,
after long years of pressure by its own weight, fairly
clear. Ice in great masses has the properties of a
viscous body, like pitch or soft sealing-wax, owing to
the fact that wherever the solid mass breaks its particles
melt a very little and then freeze again. Under increased
pressure ice melts at a lower temperature than when it
is not subjected to pressure. When the pressure is
removed the water freezes again. Thus crushed ice or
snow can be put into a “squeeze-mould” and pressed,
so as to form a solid mass of ice of any shape you may
choose. Four or five slabs of ice, placed one over the
other, very soon become, owing to this property, one
continuous solid mass. White glacier ice is so full of air
bubbles as to be comparable in structure to sponge, or,
more closely, to cork. A cube of such ice exposes,
owing to its rough air-hole pitted surface, a much larger
surface of contact to the atmosphere than does a cube
of perfectly smooth clear ice. Consequently in a warm
room or chamber the white ice melts much more quickly
than does the clear, and hence you should choose clear<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
ice rather than white ice if you wish for a block which
will last.</p>

<p>Before leaving the glaciers, let me briefly relate an
incident arising from their slow but regular downward
flow to the region where they melt away and deposit, as
a terminal moraine, the burden of rocks they have received
years before in regions far above. A young
man of five-and-twenty, on his honeymoon, visited
the Alps, and ventured alone on to a glacier. He
fell into a deep “crevasse,” or ice-fissure, and his body
was not recovered. The exact spot where he fell
into the ice-chasm was recognised, and the mountain-folk,
who knew their glacier and its rate of movement
well, told the broken-hearted young widow that it
would take thirty years before that region of the glacier
would have moved so far downwards as to reach the
lowest limit, and in due course melt away. She
haunted the glacier in which her young husband was
entombed year after year, and at last, when she was
now grey-headed and withered by time, that special
tract of ice had descended so far, and was so near the
thawing, thinned-out margin of the glacier that they
were able to break into it with axe and pole. Then
she, an old woman, had a wonderful experience. They
led her to the glacier’s edge. Her young husband, preserved
these thirty years in the ice, which had melted
around him and re-frozen, lay there unchanged. His
features were not marred by the lapse of years, nor was
his clothing rent or injured. He seemed as one asleep,
resting after a long day’s climb, and she, poor soul, had,
during a blissful interval, the conviction that all those
weary years of waiting were but a long, bad dream, that
she, too, still was young, and was waking, as she had
loved to do long years ago, in time to see him lift his
lids and smile.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_39">39. <em>Votes for Women</em></h2>
</div>


<p>Now that so many people placidly accept the notion
that women are to have votes in the election of members
of Parliament, one is tempted to ask whether science
has any facts to put forward which should be considered
before so great a change in our national organisation is
made. There are various interesting facts as to the relations
of males and females in the animal world and as to
the relative strength and activity of the sexes&mdash;which
are sometimes cited as arguments in the matter. Speaking
generally, it is clear enough that among animals the
female is endowed with qualities which bear exclusively
upon her function as the guardian of the eggs or germs
of a new generation. She nourishes those germs at the
expense of her own substance before birth, feeds them,
tends them and protects them&mdash;after birth. The male
in many cases contributes to the feeding and protection
of the young, but is as often as not quite unconcerned
with such matters. In the higher animals the male is
far more powerful than the female, and fights with other
males both for the possession of a mate or a harem, and
for the undisturbed occupation of feeding grounds for
himself and family.</p>

<p>Among lower animals there are curious cases of the
greater strength and size of the female. Thus, among
spiders, the female is nearly twice as bulky as the male.
She makes, in many cases, a nest ready for her young,
and is visited there by the wandering irresponsible male,
who, in spite of great danger to himself, is irresistibly
attracted to seek a brief caress from the terrible spideress.
She is terrible, not only on account of her bulk, but
because she makes a rule of killing, and sucking the
blood of, her infatuated admirer unless he is sufficiently
alert and agile to escape from her side more quickly<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
than he came to it. The courtship of spiders is a very
interesting bit of natural history. The males execute a
sort of dance, and are strangely excited by the vibrating
note of a tuning fork. Two American naturalists,
Mr. and Mrs. Peckham, and also Dr. McCook, have
studied this subject in great detail.</p>

<p>A strange-looking, dark green worm, as big as a
walnut, with a ribbon-like trunk six or eight inches in
length attached to its mouth, lives in holes in the rocks
in the Mediterranean. A similar worm has been found
off the Norwegian coast. Fanciful names are given by
zoologists to these two worms&mdash;the first is called
Bonellia, the second Hamingia. It does no harm to
cite their names, and I do so with an apology to those
who do not like names. These goodly sized worms are
females, only females. For years the corresponding
male was unknown. At last a minute creature one-eighth
of an inch in length, like a tiny fragment of green
thread, was found crawling about on and into these big
green Bonellias. Its structure when it was examined
with the microscope proved it to be the adult male of
the worm on which it was crawling. It was so insignificant
and minute as to escape all observation
except that of a trained naturalist searching for it with a
magnifying glass. Some seven or eight of these diminutive
males are found on one female, infesting her as fleas
infest a mouse, and of about the same relative size. The
microscopic husband of the Norwegian Hamingia it was
my good fortune to discover many years ago, when I
was dredging marine animals in the deep waters of the
Stavanger Fjord.</p>

<p>So there is nothing in the eternal fitness of things
proclaiming the male as the necessary superior of the
female throughout Nature. The fact is that the question
of equality and of general superiority and inferiority
has no place in regard to male and female from a
naturalist’s point of view. It is true that women are so<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
very much less endowed with muscular strength than
men that practically every woman is inferior to every
man in this respect. It is also true that woman’s brain
is smaller than man’s, and that apart from mere size, the
intellectual activity and capacity of women, by whatever
test you examine it, is less than that of man. When
exceptional cases on both sides are excluded, the definite
intellectual inferiority of the average woman, as compared
with the average man, is established as a fact.
The observations of those concerned in the education of
young men and young women side by side confirm this,
and it is further demonstrated by a consideration of the
intellectual performances of average men and average
women. That, at any rate, is my own experience as a
University teacher. But women, on the other hand, fill
a place in human life as mothers, and administrators of
detail, and as companions, in which man, by the nature
of things, cannot compete with them at all.</p>

<p>At the house of the late Sir James Knowles, some
twenty-five years ago, when discussing the relative value
of the physical and intellectual capacities of the men as
compared with the women of the English working class,
Mr. Gladstone (at that time the head of the Government)
said to me, “I am of opinion that the relative
value of a man and a woman is in all classes of society
about the same as it was in my grandfather’s time in
Jamaica when they purchased slaves. They gave £120
for a man and £80 for a woman, and that is a fair
measure of their relative value all the world over.” It
is necessary to remember that Mr. Gladstone was not
estimating the ultimate value of woman in human life
when he said this. He would, I think, have considered,
as I do, that it is absurd to attempt to estimate that or
to raise a discussion as to general superiority and inferiority
in reference to the male and the female of the
human species. They are creatures as necessary one as
the other, differing from one another profoundly and<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
excelling one another in diverse qualities and capacities.
Without this complementary division of fitness and
quality our life would be a monotone robbed of the
infinite variety which characterises humanity. What
Mr. Gladstone estimated as being less by one-third in
women than in men is power&mdash;work-value&mdash;whether
physical or intellectual. I think Mr. Gladstone’s estimate
must be admitted as true.</p>

<p>But I do not for a moment say that when this inferior
intellectual and physical capacity of woman is admitted
the question is settled as to whether women should vote
for the election of representatives to carry on the affairs
of the country. The affairs of the country! They are,
in the first place, the protection of person and property
by the law, which must be upheld by force if necessary;
then defence against foreign aggression, also a matter of
force; and, further, the education and training not only
of children but of the ripe youth of the country&mdash;a
matter of intellect&mdash;which also has a weighty influence in
the making of wise laws. Then there is the devising
of weapons and means of defence by land and by sea,
as well as the discovery and application of knowledge
in regard to disease, both of mind and body, for the
benefit of the community. And there will soon be
a good deal more!</p>

<p>It does not necessarily follow, because women cannot
themselves do some of these things at all, and for the
others are less able than men, that they should not give
a vote in electing the men who are to attend to them.
The only question is, Would it make life better for
both women and men were they allowed to do so?</p>

<p>The argument that the paying of taxes on men’s
property qualifies men to give a vote, and therefore
the paying of taxes on women’s property should, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso
facto</i>, entitle women to give a vote, is fallacious, because
the paying of taxes is not the reason or determining
cause of men having a vote, but only a subsidiary test<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
or qualification which might be abolished or modified.
The property of minors pays the tax, but it is not
proposed on that account that children should vote.
The property qualifications in use at present are merely
a method for excluding certain men, and we might have
an intellectual qualification or a muscular qualification
for the same purpose. Indeed, we do at present
exclude male imbeciles and those who are immature.
The reason for extending the Parliamentary vote to a
larger and larger body of the male population has been
to secure the assent of the strength and manhood of
the country to the laws and public acts of the Government,
and to ensure its willing participation in that
maintenance of the central Government’s decisions by
physical force, which is the ultimate and by no means
very remote method by which they are maintained. It
does not seem to be likely to be an improvement on
our present system that women, who must always be
regarded as specially privileged because of their physical
weakness, should nevertheless be allowed to influence by
the mere number of their votes the decision of questions
in which the employment of the physical strength of
men acting as defenders of our territory, guardians of
the peace, or ministers of the law, is the essential condition
of an effective result following on such decision.</p>

<p>To a naturalist human population does not appear
as a number of units of which a few more are female
than male&mdash;but rather as a series of families, consisting
of men, women, and children, bound together by a
variety of reciprocal services, dependent one on another,
ordered and disciplined to a distribution of functions
and duties by the tradition and experience of ages.
The notion that the paterfamilias is the rightful chief
of his wife and children, and that through him they
are represented, and should be content to be represented,
in the local and greater State Government&mdash;is
one of long standing in civilised Europe. The powers<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
of the paterfamilias have been gradually limited in
the course of the development of social life since
the young men and the old bachelors, too, have been
given a share of power in the State: but the recent
proposal to break the fabric of his household by giving
the Parliamentary franchise to women is so sudden
and strange a notion that he seems not to have realised
what it means.</p>

<p>The apathy which many men exhibit in regard to
this proposal is as remarkable as the amiable courtesy
with which others assent to it rather than “disoblige a
lady.” Looking at the proposal not as a question of
justice, which really has nothing to do with it, but in
reference to the inquiry as to whether it is likely, if
carried, to increase the happiness and prosperity of the
community, I must say that, so far as the natural
history of man gives indications, it seems to me that if
women acquired the Parliamentary franchise and made
active use of it, they would be led into a new attitude
of independence and separation from the men and from
the family group to which they are by birth or alliance
attached. I fear that the great business of making the
nest beautiful, producing and tending the young, nursing
the sick, helping the aged, consoling the afflicted, rewarding
the brave, of dancing and singing and creating
gaiety within the charmed circle where political contests
and affairs of State are of no account, would be neglected
and without honour. In the end these amenities
of life would probably fall into the hands of commercial
companies and be sent out at so much a head&mdash;imported
from Germany. Woman would not be the
gainer, for she can only gain by continuing to astonish
man by all she does for his enchantment and delight, to
serve him and to crown his life&mdash;she will only suffer by
becoming “independent.” The movement which is
supposed to lead to a higher development of womanhood,
and consists in women mobbing people on their<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
doorsteps, waving flags and shouting at other people’s
meetings, and struggling in the arms of policemen,
seems to be inconsistent with a development in the
direction which has hitherto been popular and successful
in the progress of man from savagery to decency.
It is difficult to suppose that men will really be so
blind to the facts of the real importance and true value
of women as to allow this movement to succeed whilst
they look on with vague incredulity as to its being anything
more than a huge joke.</p>

<p>There is, too, finally, one serious warning to be
derived from the ascertained facts of human physiology
and psychology. The immutable task, the sacred
destiny, of women is to become the mothers of new
generations. Nothing which is likely to interfere with
or lessen the respect and veneration due to women in
view of this tremendous natural determination of their
instincts and aspirations should be lightly sanctioned
by men so long as they have the power of deciding the
matter. There is good and sufficient ground for fearing
that the new status of women which would be established
by their entry on an equal footing with man
into the arena of political struggle and public life,
would injuriously affect in a majority or large minority
of cases that mode of life and economy of strength
which is necessary for those who must give so much to
the great and exacting demands of maternity. The
gratification of the whim of a few earnest but injudicious
women would be an altogether insufficient
justification for the injury of the “physique” of women
in general by the strain of public competition with
men, and for the widespread development in women of
an increased habit of self-assertion and self-sufficiency&mdash;habits
which must make them unwilling to accept
their natural duties as wives and mothers&mdash;and must
make men equally unwilling to promote them to these
honours and privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_40">40. <em>Tobacco and the History of Smoking</em></h2>
</div>


<p>A proposal is before Parliament to prevent little
boys from “smoking” in public places. Little girls
are, as the bill at present stands, not to be interfered
with. Perhaps this is because they are not to have
votes when they grow up, and so they may do as they
like.</p>

<p>Apart from the question as to whether the smoking
of tobacco is injurious to the health or not, there are
many curious questions which arise from time to time
as to the history and use of tobacco. I have no doubt
that for children the use of tobacco is injurious, and I
am inclined to think that it is only free from objection
in the case of strong, healthy men, and that even they
should avoid any excess, and should only smoke after
meals, and never late at night. The strongest man,
who can tolerate a cigar or a pipe after breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, may easily get into a condition of “nerves”
when even one cigarette acts as a poison and causes a
slowing of the heart’s action.</p>

<p>A curious mistake, almost universally made, is that
of supposing that the oily juice which forms in a pipe
or at the end of a cigar is “nicotine,” the chief nerve-poison
of tobacco. As a matter of fact, this juice,
though it contains injurious substances, contains little
or no “nicotine.” Nicotine is a colourless volatile
liquid, which is vapourised and carried along with the
smoke; it is not deposited in the pipe or cigar-end
except in very small quantity. It is the chief agent
by which tobacco acts on the nervous system, and
through that on the heart&mdash;the agent whose effects are
sought and enjoyed by the lover of tobacco. A single
drop of pure nicotine will kill a dog. Nicotine has no<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
aroma, and has nothing to do with the flavour of
tobacco, which is due to very minute quantities of
special volatile bodies similar to those which give a
scent to hay.</p>

<p>Most people are acquainted with the three ways of
“taking tobacco”&mdash;that of taking its smoke into the
mouth, and more or less into the lungs, that of chewing
the prepared leaf, and that of snuffing up the powdered
leaf into the nose, whence it ultimately passes to the
stomach. A fourth modification of the snuffing and
chewing methods exists in what is called the “snuff
stick.” According to the novelist, Mrs. Hodgson
Burnett, the country women in Kentucky use a short
stick, like a brush, which they dip into a paperfull of
snuff; they then rub the powder on to the gums.
Snuff-taking has almost disappeared in “polite society”
in this country within the past twenty years, but
snuffing and chewing are still largely practised by
those whose occupation renders it impossible or
dangerous for them to carry a lighted pipe or cigar&mdash;such
as sailors and fishermen and workers in many
kinds of factories and engine-rooms.</p>

<p>One of the most curious questions in regard to the
history of tobacco is that as to whether its use originated
independently in Asia or was introduced there by
Europeans. It is largely cultivated and used for
smoking throughout the East from Turkey to China&mdash;including
Persia and India on the way&mdash;and special
varieties of tobacco, the Turkish, the Persian, and the
Manilla are well known, and only produced in the East,
whilst special forms of pipe, such as the “hukah” or
“hooka,” the “hubble-bubble,” and the small Chinese
pipe are distinctively Oriental. Not only that, but the
islanders of the Far East are inveterate smokers of
tobacco, and some of them have peculiar methods of
obtaining the smoke, as, for instance, certain North
Australians who employ “a smoke-box” made of a<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
joint of bamboo. Smoke is blown into this receptacle
by a faithful spouse, who closes its opening with her
hand and presents the boxful of smoke to her husband.
He inhales the smoke and hands the bamboo joint back
to his wife for refilling. The Asiatic peoples are great
lovers of tobacco, and it is certain that in Java they
had tobacco as early as 1601, and in India in 1605.
The hookah (a pipe, with water-jar attached, through
which the smoke is drawn in bubbles) was seen and
described by a European traveller in 1614. Should we
not, therefore, suppose that in Asia they had tobacco
and practised smoking before it was introduced from
America into the West of Europe? It seems unlikely
that Western nations should have given this luxury to
the East when practically everything else of the kind
has come from the East to Europe&mdash;the grape and
wine made from it, the orange, lemon, peach, fig, spices of
all kinds, pepper and incense. Yet it is certain that
the Orientals got the habit of smoking tobacco from
us, and not we from them.</p>

<p>Incredible as it seems, the investigations of the Swiss
botanist, De Candolle (see his delightful History of
Cultivated Plants&mdash;a wonderful volume, published for
5s., in the International Scientific Series) and of
Colonel Prain, formerly in India, now Director of Kew,
have rendered it quite certain that the Orientals owe
tobacco and the habit of smoking entirely to the
Europeans, who brought it from America, as early as
1558. In the year 1560 Jean Nicot, the French
Ambassador, saw the plant in Portugal, and sent seeds
to France to Catherine de’ Medici. It was named
Nicotiana in his honour. But the introduction into
Europe of the practice of smoking is chiefly due to the
English. In 1586 Ralph Lane, the first Governor of
Virginia, and Sir Francis Drake brought over the pipes
of the North American Indians and the tobacco
prepared by them. The English enthusiasm for tobacco<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
smoking, “drinking a pipe of tobacco,” as it was at
first called, was extraordinary both for its sudden
development, its somewhat excessive character, and the
violent antagonism which it aroused, and, as we learn
from Mr. Frederic Harrison, still arouses. It was at
once called “divine tobacco” by the poet Spenser, and
“our holy herb nicotian” by William Lilly, and not
long afterwards denounced as a devilish poison by King
James. The reason why the English had most to do
with the introduction of smoking is that the inhabitants
of South America did not smoke pipes, but
chewed the tobacco, or took it as snuff, and less frequently
smoked it as a cigar. From the Isthmus
of Panama as far as Canada and California, on the
other hand, the custom of smoking pipes was universal,
and wonderful carved pipes of great variety
were found in use by the natives of these regions, and
also dug up in very ancient burial grounds. Hence the
English colonists of Virginia were the first to introduce
pipe-smoking to Europe.</p>

<p>The Portuguese had discovered the coasts of Brazil
as early as 1500, and it is they who carried tobacco to
their possessions and trading ports in the Far East&mdash;to
India, Java, China, and Japan, so that in less than a
hundred years it was well established in those countries.
Probably it went about the same time from Spain and
England to Turkey, and from there to Persia, and
rapidly developed not only special new forms of pipe
(the hookah) for its consumption, but also within a few
years special varieties of the plant itself. These were
raised by cultivation, and have formerly been erroneously
regarded as native Asiatic species of tobacco plant.</p>

<p>The definite proof of the fact that tobacco was in
this way introduced from Western Europe to the
Oriental nations is, first, that Asiatics have no word for
it excepting a corruption of the original American
name tabaco, tobacco, or tambuco: it is certain that it<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
is not mentioned in Chinese writings nor represented in
their pottery before the year 1680. In the next place,
it appears that careful examination of old herbariums
and of the records of early travellers who knew plants
well and recorded all they saw, proves that no species of
tobacco is a native of Asia. There are fifty species of
tobacco, but all are American excepting the Nicotiana
suaveolens, which is a native of the Australian
continent, and the Nicotiana fragrans, which is a native
of the Isle of Pines, near New Caledonia.</p>

<p>Forty-eight different species of tobacco (that is to
say, of the genus Nicotiana) are found in America.
Of these Nicotiana tabacum is the only one which has
been extensively cultivated. It has been found wild
in the State of Ecuador, but was cultivated by the
natives both of North and South America before the
advent of Europeans. It seems probable that all the
tobaccos grown in the Old World for smoking or
snuffing are only cultivated varieties&mdash;often with very
special qualities&mdash;of the N. tabacum, with the exception
of the Shiraz tobacco plant, which, though called
N. persica, is of Brazilian origin, and the N. rustica,
of Linnæus, a native of Mexico, which has a yellow
flower, and yields a coarse kind of tobacco. This has
been cultivated in South America and also in Asia
Minor. But tobaccos so different as the Havannah,
the Maryland and Virginian, the incomparable Latakia,
the Manilla, and the Roumelian or Turkish&mdash;all come
from culture-varieties of the one great species, Nicotiana
tabacum.</p>

<p>The treatment of tobacco-leaf to prepare it for use
in smoking, snuffing, and chewing requires great skill
and care, and is directed by the tradition and experience
of centuries. As is the case with “hay,” the dried
tobacco-leaf undergoes a kind of fermentation, and, in
fact, more than one such change. The cause of the
fermentation is a micro-organism which multiplies in<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
the dead leaf and causes chemical changes, just as the
yeast organism grows in “wort” and changes it to
“beer.” It is said that the flavour and aroma of
special tobaccos is due to special kinds of ferment,
and that by introducing the Havannah ferment or
micro-organism to tobacco-leaves grown away from
Cuba, you can give them much of the character of
Havannah tobacco! A very valuable kind of tobacco
is the Roumelian, from which the best Turkish cigarettes
are made. It has a very delicate flavour, and
very small quantities of an aromatic kind prepared
from a distinct variety of tobacco plant grown near
Ephesus and on the Black Sea (probably a cultivated
variety of Nicotiana rustica) are judiciously blended
with it. This blending, and the use of the very finest
qualities of tobacco-leaf, are essential points in the
production of the best Turkish cigarettes. The so-called
“Egyptian” cigarettes are made from less valuable
Turkish tobacco, with the addition of an excess of the
aromatic kind. It is a mistake to suppose that opium
or other matters are used to adulterate tobacco. The
only proceeding of the kind which occurs is the mixing
of inferior, cheap, and coarse-flavoured tobaccos with
better kinds. Water and also starch are used fraudulently
to increase the weight of leaf-tobacco. But
skilful “blending” is a legitimate and most important
feature in the manufacture of cigars, cigarettes, and
smoking mixtures.</p>

<p>The first “smoking” of tobacco seen by Europeans
was that of the Caribs or Indians of San Domingo.
They used a very curious sort of tubular pipe, shaped
like the letter Y. The diverging arms were placed one
up each nostril, and the end of the stem held in the
smoke of burning tobacco-leaves, which was thus
“sniffed up” into the nose. The North American
Indians, on the other hand, had pipes very similar to
those still in use. The natives of South America<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
smoked the rolled leaf (cigars), chewed it, and took it
as snuff.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that in Asia smoking of some
kind of dried herbs may have been a habit before
tobacco was introduced&mdash;since even Herodotus states
that the Scythians were accustomed to inhale the smoke
of burning weeds, and showed their enjoyment of it by
howling like dogs! But investigation does not support
the view that anything corresponding to individual
or personal “smoking” existed. “Bang” or “hashish”
(the Indian hemp) was not “smoked,” but swallowed as
a kind of paste before the introduction of tobacco-smoking
in the East&mdash;as we may gather from the
stories of the “Arabian Nights”&mdash;although the practice
of smoking hemp (which is the chief constituent of
“bang”) and also of smoking the narcotic herb
“henbane,” has now been established. Opium was,
and is, eaten in India, not “smoked.” The “smoking”
of opium is a Chinese invention of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The Oriental hookah suggests a history anterior to
the use of tobacco, but nothing is known of it. The
word signifies a cocoanut-shell, and is applied to the jar
(sometimes actually a cocoanut) containing perfumed
water, through which smoke from a pipe, fixed so as to
dip into the water, is drawn by a long tube with
mouthpiece. It seems possible that this apparatus was
in use for inhaling perfume by means of bubbles of air
drawn through rose-water or such liquids, before
tobacco-smoking was introduced, and that the tobacco-pipe
and the perfume-jar were then combined. But
travellers before the year 1600 do not mention the
existence of the hookah in Persia or in India, though
as soon as tobacco came into use this apparatus is
described by Floris, in 1614, and by Olearius, in 1633,
and by all subsequent travellers.</p>

<p>The conclusion to which careful inquiry has led is<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
that though various Asiatic races have appreciated the
smoke of various herbs and enjoyed inhaling it from
time immemorial, yet there was no definite “smoking”
in earlier times. No pipes or rolled-up packets of dried
leaves&mdash;to be placed in the mouth and sucked whilst
slowly burning&mdash;were in use before the introduction
of tobacco by Europeans, who brought the tobacco-plant
from America and the mode of enjoying its
smoke, and passed on its seeds to the people of Turkey,
Persia, India, China, and Japan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CH_41">41. <em>Cruelty, Pain and Knowledge</em></h2>
</div>


<p>It is difficult to write or to read or even to think
about “cruelty” and preserve one’s sober judgment and
reason. Most people are upset by emotion when torture
and the details of the infliction of pain are discussed.
All the more must we remember that emotion is a powerful
driving force, but a bad guide. Only true knowledge
and sound reasoning can guide us aright.</p>

<p>An awful fact about the emotional state produced by
witnessing or hearing about the agonies of human beings
or of sentient animals is that to some people (actually
very few and diminishing in number among civilised
races) it is distinctly a source of pleasure, though to
most of us it is intolerably painful. This fact forms
one of the most difficult problems of psychology. It
seems that just as there are people who enjoy seeing
dangerous acrobatic performances or climbing themselves
among ice and rocks at the risk of their lives, or reading
of hairbreadth escapes, of bloody murders, of ghosts,
and other horrors&mdash;all of which are repulsive to the
majority&mdash;so there are some people who experience
delicious shudderings&mdash;“des frissons exquis”&mdash;when
they see a man or an animal in torture or read a description
of such things. In the eighteenth century it was<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
not unusual for a country cousin on a visit to London
to be taken as a treat to see half a dozen men and boys
hanged at Newgate, and then to complete the happy
day by a visit to Bedlam to see the madmen flogged!
Fortunately, public opinion and education seem to have
been able actually to alter the operation of the emotions
excited by these brutalities&mdash;so that to-day practically
everyone in the Western States of Europe regards the
unnecessary infliction of pain with horror and indignation,
and is anxious to avoid witnessing pain, even in
cases where it is a necessary evil.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that there is any tendency
on the part of scientific men or medical men to be callous
or indifferent to the infliction of pain. The surgeon
sometimes has to inflict pain in order to prevent greater
future pain or death&mdash;but he is not indifferent to the
pain he causes. He is not even “cruel only to be kind”&mdash;but
appears cruel to the unthinking because he has to
give pain which he knows will save his patient from far
greater pain, and he has to maintain a calm and determined
attitude in order to help those around him to
exercise self-control. The medical art is, above all
things, an art of removing and abolishing pain, and its
practitioners are all the more sensitive concerning pain
because they know more and see more of it than other
people, and make it their chief business to alleviate
suffering.</p>

<p>Charles Darwin took a prominent part twenty-five
years ago in urging the Government of the day not to
make a law which would prevent physiologists and
medical men from obtaining knowledge as to animal
life and disease by experiment. The great naturalist
was a great lover of animals and a most gentle and
tender-hearted man. He wrote to me in 1870: “Experiment
must, of course, be allowed for the progress of
physiology and medicine, but not for damnable and
detestable curiosity. I will write no more about it, or<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
I shall not sleep to-night.” Mr. Darwin was alluding
to horrible so-called “experiments” which in former
days&mdash;especially in the latter part of the eighteenth
century&mdash;were made by utterly irresponsible and ignorant
amateurs, witnessed by fashionable ladies, and
reported in the newspapers and letters of the day. It
is these reckless and useless “experiments” which rightly
excited horror and opposition a century ago, and were
described by the name “vivisection.” We have to thank
these blundering philosophers of the salons of a past
age for the mistaken feeling with which some people
regard the really valuable and careful investigations
which are made by medical men at the present day, with
the use of every precaution to prevent pain to the
animals used.</p>

<p>The testing of drugs, the inoculation of parasitic
disease, and the trial of different modes of removing or
controlling the disease so inoculated, carried on by
highly trained and learned men, who thoroughly know
what they are about, and who communicate with one
another from all parts of the world as to the progress
they are making in curing or even abolishing diseases,
such as diphtheria, cholera, sleeping sickness, and phthisis
are very different from the impudent unscientific “experiments”
of the days of Horace Walpole. The
inquiries carried on in the modern laboratories of our
great universities should not for a moment be confused
with the horrors performed to glorify and show the
superior cold-bloodedness of drawing-room pretenders
to science, in those strange times.</p>

<p>I believe that most sensible people feel as Mr. Darwin
felt, and I myself would certainly subscribe to what he
wrote to me in the letter which I have quoted above.
Amongst those who feel thus strongly on the subject
there are some who can control their emotion and calmly
consider whether the pain inflicted under any given circumstances
is justifiable as leading to a great ultimate<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
diminution of pain by the knowledge obtained. There
are others who are constitutionally incapable of controlling
their emotion in this matter. They hear dreadful
stories of cruelty, and are so upset that they are
incapable of ascertaining whether the stories are true or
not. They are quite unfit to weigh the question as to
whether the pain given in the case they hear of may or
may not be a necessary step towards avoiding far greater
pain in the future for thousands of human beings and
sentient animals. Far be it from me to think harshly of
these tender-hearted people, though their mistaken outcry
may tend to stop the discovery of pain-saving and
life-saving knowledge. I feel more sympathy with them
than with those (happily rare) individuals who are really
indifferent to seeing or giving bodily pain to men or to
animals.</p>

<p>There is reason to hope that careful and well-considered
statement of the facts will eventually enable
many of those who are mentally unhinged by descriptions
of pain and bloodshed to recognise that they have
been deceived, partly by their own fancies and partly by
the false statements of professional agitators. Unfortunately,
there are always present in human society individuals
who find it to their advantage to excite the
minds of their more emotional fellow-citizens by tales
of horror. The lust of such power&mdash;the power to lead
or urge a large body of men driven by emotional excitement
into violent action&mdash;has led from time to time to
exaggeration, misrepresentation, and elaborate plot and
perjury directed against a group of innocent or worthy
people, whose proceedings were mysterious or misunderstood
by the community at large. Thus, from time to
time, the crowd has been infuriated and led to the
murder of the Jews by agitators, who started the baseless
story that the Jews had slain a Christian child, and
used its blood at their feast of the Passover. Titus
Oates and Lord George Gordon made use of the unreasoning<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
emotion of the crowd in the same way. To
a less serious extent the emotional unreasonableness of
a number of men and women is being played upon at
the present day by quite a large variety of agitators,
would-be leaders of crusades and campaigns against the
beneficent work of the physiological and medical laboratories
of our universities and medical schools.</p>

<p>There are one or two other features about “cruelty”
and the mental conditions leading to and arising from
it, which, however uncanny and troubling, should be
carefully considered when public opinion is roused in
regard to its repression. Among these is the fact that
the word is freely applied to the mere infliction of pain
without consideration of the question as to whether
there is a guilty mind determining it. Storms and frosts
are called “cruel” by poetic license; but it is probably
quite wrong to call a cat or a tiger cruel. These animals
take pleasure in playing with their prey, as they would
with an inanimate ball or mechanical toy. There is no
reason to suppose that they are conscious of the infliction
of pain or take pleasure in pain as pain. And so
it must happen sometimes with thoughtless human
beings who disregard the pain which they cause, when
eagerly engaged in “sport” or in the pursuit of some all-absorbing
and consuming purpose. The whole subject
of cruelty is a distressing one, but should not on that
account be misapprehended or dealt with wildly and
blindly.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago a Royal Commission sat which
was appointed to inquire as to what restrictions, if any,
it was desirable to place upon the practice of making
experiments on animals for physiological and medical
purposes. As a result of its labours an Act of Parliament
was passed which made definite regulations for the
purpose of preventing unqualified persons from indulging
in reckless experiments on animals. There were
stories circulated by the agitators then&mdash;as there are<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
now&mdash;to the effect that medical students perform horrible
and painful operations (vivisections, as the agitators
term them,) on live animals in secret or with the connivance
of their teachers. It was proved twenty-five
years ago that these stories were false. At the same
time an elaborate law was passed to satisfy the emotional
persons misled by the agitators, which made it necessary
for an experimenter (1) to have a licence (dependent on a
certificate as to his competency); (2) that he should use
anæsthetics; and (3) that experiments should only be
carried out in licensed laboratories.</p>

<p>The agitators of the present day have by heart-rending
stories, similar to those told twenty-five years ago,
produced a similar excitement and a similar result,
namely, a Royal Commission on Vivisection, which has
been occupied for a year and a half in listening to the
statements and delusions of those who declare that the
law made twenty-five years ago is insufficient, and that
all sorts of cruelties are committed by the physiologists
and doctors. The Commission has also questioned the
leading physiologists and medical men in the country,
and listened to their voluntary statements. I have seen
the very voluminous report of the evidence thus given
on both sides. The various accusations made against
the medical men in the conduct of their laboratories
have been carefully gone into. It is contended, on their
side, that these charges are based on misunderstanding&mdash;the
misunderstanding which one would expect from an
ignorant person with a strong feeling or prejudice in the
direction of the misunderstanding. For instance, the
fact that chloroform is administered and the animal
rendered insensible when operated on, has been overlooked
in some of the accounts which excited the so-called
“antivivisectors”&mdash;notably in the misleading
account of “the brown dog.” The whole of the evidence
should be read by those who are really in doubt on the
matter. Probably it will not be long before the Commission<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
reports, and its conclusions will command the very
greatest respect, not only because its members include
eminent lawyers, medical men and independent representatives
who were ready to give an impartial mind to
the inquiry, but also because it is obvious that the very
greatest care has been taken to obtain the fullest evidence
from both sides.</p>

<p>Sir James Fletcher Moulton, one of the Lords Justices
of the Court of Appeal, has made a statement to the
Commission in defence of scientific experiment which is
a masterpiece of persuasive reasoning and lucid exposition.
It is somewhat remarkable that there have been
and are persons in high judicial office who have shown
active hostility to the cause of science and knowledge in
this matter owing to their want of acquaintance with
the facts and their readiness to be carried away by blind
emotion. Lord Justice Moulton, on the other hand, is
a scientific man by education and early training, and has
come forward to state in a plain and reasonable way what
is the view of the matter which commends itself to him.
There is reason to hope that his view will be approved
by those who read what he says calmly and without bias.
His chief point is that many people are willing to admit
that it is right to destroy animals (even by methods
which inflict great pain on them) when an immediate
result of a good and useful kind is to be obtained&mdash;as
when we kill animals to serve as food or in order to prevent
them from injuring us or destroying our crops and
stores. Yet these same persons, he points out, by some
defect of imagination are unable to see that the gaining
of pain-saving or disease-preventing knowledge as the
result of inflicting pain and death on a small number of
animals justifies us in permitting that pain and death.
They are unable to admit the justification because the
knowledge and its practical application does not directly
and at once follow upon the first commencement of the
search for it, and they have not sufficient acquaintance<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
with the matter to enable them to realise and confidently
believe that the beneficent result will ensue. The knowledge
has to be built up step by step, and the infliction
of pain on the animals is separated by an appreciable
lapse of time from the beneficent result&mdash;which is none
the less the result which was aimed at, and the true consequence
of the pain inflicted. Putting aside for the
moment the fact that in these inquiries the pain is reduced
to a minimum by the use of anæsthetics, it would
seem that we ought to be able to recognise that the
causing of a certain amount of pain to many hundreds
of rabbits, and even dogs, is justified by the consequent
removal of a far greater amount of pain from thousands
of men and animals who are saved from suffering at a
later date by the knowledge so gained.</p>

<p>Lord Justice Moulton suggests two cases of the infliction
of pain on animals for comparison. Suppose, he
says, a ship to arrive in port which (as might easily
happen to-day) is infested by plague-stricken rats; there
are, perhaps, ten or twenty thousand rats on board. If
the rats escaped and landed they might (not certainly,
but probably) infect a whole city, even a much larger
area, with plague, and cause death and disaster to thousands
of human beings. Everyone will agree that the
owner of the ship would be justified in destroying all the
rats on the ship by sulphur fumes, or whatever other
painful method might be necessary to prevent even one
from escaping. A vast amount of suffering would be
inflicted on the rats in order to prevent a far greater
contingent amount of suffering. Now suppose that a
man, by infecting some hundreds of rats and other animals
with plague, and by trying various experiments on
these animals with curative drugs, and by other operations
upon them, can in all probability arrive at such a
knowledge of plague and how to check it as to enable us
to arrest its propagation, and so to save thousands, or
even millions, of human beings from this painful and<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
deadly disease, are we to say that this investigator must
not carry on his studies, must not find out how to stop
plague in future because to do so he will have to give
some amount of pain to a hundred or more animals?
Clearly, if we justify the shipowner we must justify the
inquiries and experiments of the medical discoverer. In
both cases we must hold&mdash;every sane man really does
hold&mdash;that it is right to inflict pain with the expectation
(not a certainty in either case, but only a reasonable
probability) of preventing a far larger and more serious
amount of pain in the future. It is the choice of the
lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>And thus we are led to admit that it is right that
experiments and studies attended with some pain to
animals should be carried on, on condition that competent
and serious persons make them, for the purpose of
gaining increased knowledge of the processes of life and
disease. Such studies have already yielded great results&mdash;the
pain in the wards of hospitals and in sick rooms
is not a tenth of what it was a hundred years ago. The
death-rate of great cities is a third less than it was fifty
years ago. Modern medicine and modern surgery are
really and demonstrably immense agencies for preventing
pain and the anguish and misery which is caused by
untimely death.</p>

<p>A Society for the Defence of Research has been
established this year (1908) with the Earl of Cromer as
its president. The Society has issued some valuable
pamphlets showing what improvements in medical
knowledge have been recently effected by means of
inoculations and other experiments in which animals
have been used though subjected to as little pain and
discomfort as consistent with the enquiries made.
Ignorant opponents of medical research assert that the
scientific study of the processes of life and disease in
laboratories has not helped in the great progress in
medical practice which marks the last fifty years. But<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
the medical men who are the leaders of their profession
unanimously assert, and prove by detailed accounts of
the discoveries made, that such study has been essential
to the progress established, and is essential for further
progress. Lord Lister, who by his antiseptic method
of treating surgical wounds has saved more pain to
present and future generations of men than all the
torturers of the Inquisition ever inflicted or dreamed of
inflicting, has been the leader in declaring the
inestimable value to humanity&mdash;in fact, the absolute
necessity&mdash;of physiological experiments on animals.
Whose judgment on this question can be considered of
greater value than his?</p>

<p>The anti-vivisection agitators, for the purpose of
exciting the emotions of those who listen to them, use
the word “torture” as describing the action of such
men as Pasteur and Lord Lister. To torture is to
inflict an ever-increasing amount of pain, with the view
of “extorting” a submission, a confession, or treasure
from a victim. To suggest that scientific and medical
men apply pain in this way, and to spread the word
“torture” among the ignorant, emotional public, in
connection with their inquiries, is dishonest as well as
ungrateful.</p>

<p>One valuable result of the work of the present Royal
Commission on what is called “Vivisection,” but should
be called “the use of animals in the discovery of means
of controlling disease and alleviating pain,” is that it is
made quite clear that there is very little pain at all
inflicted in this beneficent work, owing to the fact that
anæsthetics and narcotics are administered to the
animals when anything which might cause pain is done.
I do not hesitate to say that there is in this country less
pain caused in a whole year in all the laboratories where
this great work for the public good is carried on than
in a single day’s rabbit-shooting.</p>

<p>It is important to correct, if possible, the misunderstanding<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
which very naturally exists as to what physiologists
and doctors mean by “experiment.” In ordinary
language an “experiment” suggests a haphazard venture,
the doing of something blindly and in ignorance, just
“to see what will happen.” It is true that long ago in
the eighteenth century there were men callous enough
and ignorant enough to make such “fool’s experiments”
on living animals. But when scientific men speak of
“the experimental method” and the acquisition of
knowledge by experiment, they do not allude to
haphazard attempts to see what will happen when
something extraordinary is done. The experiment of
the experimental method is arranged so as to provide a
definite answer to a definite question, and the question
has been thought out by a man who knows the whole
record of previous experiment and knowledge in regard
to the subject which is under investigation.</p>

<p>Thus in the inquiry as to the possible prevention of
the deadly effect of snake poison introduced into the
human body by the bite of snakes, the first question
asked was, “Is it true, as sometimes stated, that a
poisonous snake is not poisoned by having its own
poison injected into its flesh?” The experiment was
tried. The answer was, “It is true.” Next it was asked,
“Is this due to the action of very small doses of the
poison which pass constantly from the poison gland into
the snake’s blood, and so render the snake ‘immune,’ as
happens in the case of other poisons?” The experiment
was tried. Snakes without poison glands were found to
be killed by the introduction of snake’s poison in a full
dose into their blood. Then it was found that a horse
could be injected with a dose of snake poison, or half
the quantity necessary to cause death, and that it
recovered in a few days. The question was now put,
“Is the horse so treated rendered immune to snake
poison, as the snake is which receives small doses of
poison into its blood from its own poison gland?”<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
Accordingly the experiment was made. The horse was
given a full dose of snake poison, and did not suffer any
inconvenience. At intervals of two days it was given
increasing injections of snake poison without suffering
in any way, until at last an injection in one dose of
thirty times the deadly quantity of snake poison&mdash;that
is, enough to kill thirty unprepared horses&mdash;was made
into the same horse, and it did not show the smallest
inconvenience. The question was thus answered:
Immunity to snake-bite can be conferred by the
absorption of small quantities (non-lethal doses) of
snake poison. The next question was this: “If something
has been formed in the horse’s blood by this
process, which is an antidote to snake poison, should it
not be possible, by removing some of the horse’s blood
and injecting a small quantity of it into a smaller
animal, to protect that animal from snake bite?” The
experiment was accordingly made. Rabbits and dogs
received injections of the blood of the immune horse.
An hour after they received full doses of snake poison.
They suffered no inconvenience at all; they were
“protected,” or “rendered immune.” The next
question was, “Will the antidote act on an animal after
it has already been bitten by a snake?” The
experiment was made. Rabbits were injected with
snake poison. After a quarter of an hour they were
on the point of death. A dose of the immune horse’s
blood was now injected into each&mdash;in ten minutes they
had completely recovered and were feeding. The means
was thus found of preventing death from snake-bite.
The protective horse-blood was properly prepared, and
sent out at once to Cochin China and to India. It was
there tried upon human beings who had been
accidentally bitten by deadly snakes, and it proved
absolutely effective; it saved the men’s lives. It is now
used (wherever it can be obtained in time) as the sure
antidote to snake-bite, though it is not at present<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
possible to supply it whenever and wherever it is needed.
That is an example, briefly told, of the experimental
questioning of Nature&mdash;such as is pursued in the
laboratories of medical men and physiologists. They
do not perform haphazard experiments; but each
experiment is so arranged as to give a definite answer
to a definite question, leading to a large result. By no
other process can knowledge of many things, which it is
urgent for us to have, be obtained. We should have to
wait centuries if we merely watched Nature, and hoped
for some accidental circumstance to reveal the facts.</p>

<p>What, after all, do we understand and mean by
“pain”? It is not merely the sharp sting, and
consequent shrinking caused by wounds and violence.
That, we know well enough, is a beneficent arrangement
by which men as well as animals are prevented
from knocking themselves to pieces, and are driven into
avoiding danger to life and limb. But “pain”
includes, besides this, the anguish arising from the weary,
fruitless struggle against disease and starvation, from
the disaster to the household caused by the untimely
death of its mainstay, from the slaughter of children by
poisonous foods, and from the neglect of the laws of
health of body and mind.</p>

<p>Ignorance, the “curse of Hell,” is the cause of all
suffering. Knowledge is the wing which takes us
heavenward, and frees us from misery. I cannot put it
better than in Shakespeare’s words. It is man’s destiny
to diminish pain on this earth, and that not by timidly
shrinking from and emotionally raving about the
horrors of pain, but by facing them and deliberately
accepting the responsibility of producing a small and
brief suffering to a few animals as the price of the
salvation of his fellow-creatures from the far greater
pain which is the assured and fatal companion of
ignorance&mdash;accursed ignorance!</p>

<p>A recent writer has told us that he cannot believe<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
that good will follow from the wilful destruction by
man of Nature’s greatest and most beautiful production&mdash;a
living thing. He poses as a sentimentalist and
seems to regard it as the indication of a superior and
gentle mind to refuse to sanction the removal or even
the temporary discomfort of what Nature has called
into life. I, too, claim to be a sentimentalist, but the
sentiment which thrills me is one of revolt against the
needless and remediable suffering of all humanity&mdash;suffering
which man has brought on himself by his
stumbling, half-hearted resistance to Nature’s drastic
method of purifying and strengthening the race, her
remorseless slaughter of the unfit. It is this suffering
which some would allow their fellow-men still to endure,
now and for generations to come, rather than have their
own tranquillity disturbed by the record of that
modicum of immediate pain and sacrifice of animal life
which is the price of freedom for mankind from far
greater pain hereafter. We have to learn to mitigate
and to minimise pain, not to run away from it. It is
childish to weep over the distortion and destruction of
Nature’s products by man’s violence and ignorance.
What we can and should do is to see that our dealings
with this fair earth and its living freight are guided not
by vain regret, but by knowledge and foresight.</p>
